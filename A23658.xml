            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>ONE would think any thing ſhould be acceptable to diſſenting Brethren, which has a true tendency to deliver them from thoſe miſtaken notions of things which do expoſe them to much trouble from Men, and from the Laws themſelves, and by means of which they are an occaſion of trouble and danger to the Nation. And it is but reaſonable to expect
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:40113:3"/>that things of this nature ſhould be conſider'd by them now at ſuch a time as this, tho' neglected du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time in which thoſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions put them to no trouble. The hope of which and the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to ſee Chriſtian Brethren to ſuffer great inconveniencies to themſelves needleſly, has been a motive to me to make theſe ſheets publick at this time; as not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but that if judiciouſly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially weighed, they with other writings of like nature, may be of good uſe to diſcover to them their miſtakes.</p>
            <p>Their Separation from parochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Communion which does expoſe them to trouble, does proceed prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally from their miſtakes (as I conceive them to be) either about
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:40113:3"/>that which makes men members of the viſible Church, or that which gives them Right to the external Priviledges thereof, or about the external manner of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worſhip. There are many of the Diſſenters whoſe notion of the viſible Church, and of Mens Right to Communion in the external Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of it, ſeems much nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower than the Scriptures repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thoſe things to be. They make that to be neceſſary to <hi>viſible</hi> Church-member-ſhip and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which is but neceſſary to <hi>Inviſible</hi> Church-Communion. And then they make this qualification neceſſary not only by way of <hi>Duty,</hi> but of <hi>Condition</hi> alſo, without which in humane judgement per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ought not to be admitted into
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:40113:4"/>Church fellowſhip, or unto Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in the external privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Church. Which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and correſpondent practice of theirs, I have endeavored to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to be plainly contrary to the whole current of the Scriptures touching theſe matters, both of the Old Teſtament and of the New, both as to doctrine and matters of fact.</p>
            <p>That which hath betrayed them into this miſtake, ſeems to have been the want of diſtinguiſhing between the internal and external ſtate of the Church; for want of which they confound them, and make that which is but neceſſary to the Being of the Church as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, to be ſo likewiſe to the Being of it as it is viſible. The
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:40113:4"/>Church being deſcribed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture but as a little flock, and that as our Saviour ſays there are but few which find the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row way which leads to Life, and enter in at the ſtrait gate; and becauſe the qualification of thoſe of the inviſible Church who ſhall be ſaved, as deſcribed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, ſeems to agree but to a few of thoſe who profeſs the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion; and becauſe the Church is but <hi>One;</hi> hereupon they come to be perſuaded that none are really and truly of the Church but ſuch whoſe qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion agrees with their deſcription to whom Salvation is indeed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. But as for others they eſteem them no more to be true and real Members of the Church,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:40113:5"/>than wooden Legs and glaſs Eyes are Members of the Body of a Man.</p>
            <p>But then there are Scriptures which muſt be conſidered likewiſe which have foretold of the coming of many whole Nations into the Church both Kings and their People, and of the numerous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of it, when <hi>a little one ſhall become a thouſand, and a ſmall one a ſtrong Nation: when the ſtone cut out of the mountain without hands ſhall fill the wole Earth,</hi> when for number <hi>they ſhall ſay the place is too ſtrait for me: give place to me that I may dwell,</hi> and the like; for there are many ſuch Predictions in Scripture. Now unleſs they will ſay that
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:40113:5"/>whole Nations and thoſe vaſt numbers forementioned, are all of the Church as inviſible (which is more then they will or can ſay) they muſt of neceſſity admit of a diſtinction of a two-fold ſtate of one and the ſame Catholick Church, the one external and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the other internal and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. And if this diſtinction be admitted, then theſe Predictions concerning the vaſt extent of the Church, will be fairly reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to thoſe other Scriptures which ſpeak of it in a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted and limited ſenſe; without which they ſeem irreconcileable. For what ſome Scriptures ſpeak touching the paucity or fewneſs of Church-members, and what others ſay touching a far greater number,
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:40113:6"/>of which the Church doth and will conſiſt, are both true in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent reſpects; the one in reſpect of the Internal and Inviſible ſtate of the Church; the other in reſpect of that which is external and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. And this diſtinction is fairly juſtified by what our bleſſed Saviour hath ſaid more than once, to wit, that <hi>many are called, but few are choſen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if any ſhould fancie that this twofold ſtate of Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers implies two Churches, the one viſible, the other inviſible; there is no ground for it, ſince thoſe who are of the Church as inviſible, are the ſame Perſons which are in external and viſible <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Communion with thoſe who are of the Church only as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:40113:6"/>and ſo make one Church with them. But we cannot ſay they make one Church with theſe, and another by themſelves, for then there would be two Churches indeed, and yet of the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for a conſiderable part.</p>
            <p>Conſidering then this twofold ſtate of the Church, it will not be difficult at all to conceive how and why a participation in the external priviledges of the Church, does belong to all that are externally and viſibly of it, when yet a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation in the internal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible priviledges of it, belongs only to thoſe who are of the Church in reſpect of its inviſible as well as viſible ſtate. As there are different qualifications of perſons of the ſame Church, ſo there are
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:40113:7"/>different priviledges which belong to them accordingly; external ones to them who are only externally qualified, and both external and internal ones to them who are qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for both.</p>
            <p>Now this different ſtate of the Church being ſo apparent as it is in Scripture; as alſo that thoſe who have but common grace and yet Baptized, are really and truly of the viſible Church: I ſay the conſideration of theſe things hath enclined me to touch upon ſeveral things which ſeem to render it very improbable at leaſt, that the Apoſtles ſhould admit none into the Church by Baptiſm, but ſuch as they judged to believe ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as to be thereby Regenerate before they would Baptize them.
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:40113:7"/>To what is ſaid in my inquiries into theſe matters, I ſhall here add a little more for our better <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding that caſe or que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
            <p>The queſtion is whether it be probable that the Apoſtles ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted none into the Church by Baptiſm, but upon Suppoſition that they had a true juſtifying ſaving faith before ſuch admiſſion. And hereby faith in this queſtion is not meant faith objectively, but ſubjectively conſidered. For it is agreed that a profeſſion of a belief of the ſame truth doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally conſidered, is neceſſary to viſible Church-memberſhip by Baptiſm in the adult, which if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved as it ought to be; will be ſufficient unto Juſtification and
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:40113:8"/>Salvation: and ſuch is the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God,</hi> John <hi>20.31.</hi> Acts <hi>8.37.</hi> But the queſtion is whether a leſs degree of belief of ſaving doctrine be not ſufficient to viſible Church-memberſhip, than is ſufficient unto Juſtification and Salvation? and whether it is not probable that the Apoſtles did admit ſome into the Church by Baptiſm upon the appearance and probable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſuch a Faith? And in order to the making a due judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this caſe, it is neceſſary to know what this Faith is, and wherein it differs from juſtifying and ſaving Faith. The one for diſtinction ſake we call a Faith <hi>initial</hi> or <hi>inchoate,</hi> the other a Faith <hi>conſummate</hi> or complete.
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:40113:8"/>The initial Faith ſtands in ſuch a lower degree of aſſent of the mind unto the Truth of the Goſpel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt his being the Son of God or Saviour of Sinners, as has not yet thorow its power over the Will, renewed the whole man ſo as to become Regenerate or a new creature. But the Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate or complete lies in ſuch a firm aſſent of the mind unto the Truth of the Goſpel, as by which through frequent conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the things aſsented to, the Will is changed and renewed in its inclinations, motions and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, in reference both to Sin and Duty.</p>
            <p>This difference between Faith and Faith is fairly ſet out in the Scriptures. St. <hi>James,</hi> chap. <hi>2.</hi>
               <pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:40113:9"/>treats of a Faith that will not avail to Juſtification and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and of that alſo which will. The one is the Faith which is <hi>alone or by it ſelf,</hi> verſe <hi>15.</hi> which has not yet purified the heart from earthly affections, and fleſhly luſts, nor brought forth the fruit of the Spirit, but is dead, and remains barren. But the other Faith which will avail to Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, is operative and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, producing internal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal acts of Chriſtian Obedience, by which its made perfect, ver. <hi>22.</hi> that is, it is thereby made to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain its end in the Juſtification of the perſon that hath it. This Faith worketh by Love, and is thereby conſummate or made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. <hi>Gal. 5.</hi> For the <hi>Greek</hi> word
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:40113:9"/>according to learned Authors, is in the middle voice, and may be taken actively or paſſively, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both, it working by Love, is thereby conſummate or made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> underſtands it in a paſſive ſence, and reads it thus, <hi>Faith which is conſummate by Love.</hi> When St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I could not write to you as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſpiritual but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Chriſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the envy, ſtrife and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion they lived in, <hi>1 Cor. 3.1.</hi> his words ſeem to intimate that men might be babes in Chriſt by ſuch a Faith as fell ſhort of puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the heart, and working by love, and which left them in a carnal ſtate. And when S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Add to your Faith Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi>
               <pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:40113:10"/>&amp;c. <hi>2 Pet. 1.5.</hi> he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it very poſſible for ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to have a faith without the addition of thoſe Chriſtian virtues there enumerated, and to <hi>be bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and unfruitful in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, as it follows <hi>Verſ. 8, 9.</hi> And we read of ſome who believed in Chriſt when they ſaw his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, to whom yet he would not commit himſelf, <hi>Joh. 2.23.</hi> and of others who believed on him, but would not confeſs him, leſt they ſhould be put out of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, and becauſe they loved the praiſe of men more than the praiſe of God. <hi>John 12.42.</hi> And its ſaid of <hi>Magus</hi> that <hi>Simon</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alſo believed, <hi>Act. 8.13.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:40113:10"/>
            <p>This may ſuffice to ſhew what that Faith is which falls ſhort of that which is Juſtifying, and wherein it differs from it. I ſhall now improve this to ſhew how unlikely a thing it is, that the Apoſtles ſhould receive none into the Church by Baptiſm but ſuch as they eſteem'd to have a Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> It is no ways probable that thoſe who had lived in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Paganiſm, ſhould ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily if at all, in their firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to believe, believe unto Juſtification, but that there was ſome ſpace of time between their firſt believing, and their believing unto Juſtification: and if ſo, then it cannot be probable that the Apoſtles who Baptiſed men
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:40113:11"/>preſently and when they firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to believe, would Baptize them under the notion of their having already believed unto Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. Now the reaſon why it is not probable that ſuch men when they firſt began to believe, did then believe unto Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this; becauſe men do not believe unto Juſtification untill their Faith hath wrought ſuch a change in the whole man as by which they become Regenerate, as I have ſhew'd: for we cannot ſay God juſtifies unregenerate men while they are ſuch. Now ſuch a change as this, is not ordinarily if at all, wrought in an inſtant and as ſoon as men begin to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. For the word of God by believing of which this change is
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:40113:11"/>wrought, does not effect it phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, but morally, by cauſing ſuch thoughts and conſiderations to riſe in the mind, as do by degrees alter and change the moral frame and conſtitution of the Soul. For tho' the Spirit of God is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Agent, and the word of God his Inſtrument in this work, yet he cauſeth this change by working upon mens thoughts, and by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſeriouſly to conſider the things they believe, whereunto they tend, and how they were concern'd in them. And mens diſcerning things of this nature, and conſequently their thoughts and conſiderations about them are brought on but by degrees, as light comes in, being confuſedly and indiſtinctly diſcerned at firſt.
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:40113:12"/>And the aſſent of the mind to the truth of things to be believed, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exceed the minds diſcerning the credibility of the evidence upon which they are to be believed, but ſo long as the one is weak the other will be weak alſo. And ſo far as the aſſent of the mind is but weak, ſo far its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration upon the will to alter and change it, will be but weak like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; as the one is wrought gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually, ſo is the other. Men may be forced to believe whether they will or no thro' the ſtrength of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, as that ſignifies the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the mind, when yet the will is not thereby prevailed upon to conſent and yield to the dictates of the mind, for ſome conſiderable time, and ſometimes never. And
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:40113:12"/>let a mans faith or belief be what it will, yet untill it prevails over the will (which is the great wheel in the Soul, that gives motion both to a mans affections and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) to alter and change it as to its prevailing bent and inclination, its far enough from putting a man into a juſtified ſtate. And when ever the will is brought to comply with the aſſent and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the mind in this great matter, yet it is then ordinarily a work of time and the fruit of many thoughts and conſiderations: for want of which tho' men do believe, their Faith will languiſh and bring forth no fruit to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as we are taught in the Parable by the ſeed which did ſo for want of much Earth, which
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:40113:13"/>anſwers to the want of many thoughts and conſiderations.</p>
            <p>All theſe things conſider'd then, that ſince a Faith which hath not Regenerated thoſe in whom it is, falls ſhort of a Juſtifying Faith; and ſince Faith in its beginning and loweſt pitch is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ſo weak and inoperative to effect ſo great a change as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation ſignifies, untill by many thoughts and conſiderations it has gathered ſome ſtrength; and ſince for it to do ſo is a work of time; and ſince the Apoſtles from whoſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings theſe things are collected, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed thoſe upon their firſt believing or beginning to believe, who had untill then lived in the darkneſs of Paganiſm; I ſay theſe things conſidered, make it very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:40113:13"/>that the Apoſtles Baptiſed none but upon ſuppoſition and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable preſumption that they all had a juſtifying Faith before they Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed them.</p>
            <p>If any ſhall ſay it was upon a charitable perſwaſion in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles that thoſe whom they Baptiſed had ſuch a Faith as by which they either were already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated and juſtified, or would be in time, that they Baptiſed them, I ſhall not oppoſe them herein. But the ſaying thus does ſuppoſe and grant that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did not account ſuch a Faith as by which men were already before Baptiſm regenerate and juſtified, neceſſary to qualifie them for Baptiſm, if they had but ſuch a Faith which gave them
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:40113:14"/>ground to hope that it might in time be improved ſo as to become a juſtifying Faith; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion is every whit as much as I plead for.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> It is not probable that the Apoſtles received none into the viſible Church by Baptiſm, but ſuch as they eſteemed to be of the Church as inviſible by a Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith, becauſe they could not but know that many are really and truly of the viſible Church, and are ſo eſteemed by God, who yet are not of the Church as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible by ſuch a Faith. That ſuch are of the viſible Church in the account of the Scriptures, both of the Old Teſtament and of the New, I have I ſuppoſe ſufficiently proved in ſome of the
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:40113:14"/>following Enquiries. And if this was and is the currant doctrine of the Scriptures of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and of thoſe written by the Apoſtles, we cannot ſuppoſe them to be ignorant of it: And if they were not, it is not reaſonable to ſuppoſe they would reckon more neceſſary to qualifie men for their enterance into the viſible Church, than was neceſſary to their being of it.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> The Apoſtles had Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Baptiſe Diſciples and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers without limitation or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; and thoſe who had but the initial Faith which I before deſcribed, are in Scripture ſaid to have believed and to have been diſciples, as is ſhew'd in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Papers; and therefore
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:40113:15"/>the Apoſtles Commiſſion to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, muſt needs extend to the Baptiſing of ſuch. And it is no ways likely that the Apoſtles would make exception in reference to the Baptiſing of perſons, where their Commiſſion made none, but that they Baptiſed all that were at all diſciples as ſuch, without diſcrimination or making a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between believers and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, or diſciples and diſciples, in reference to their Baptiſing of ſuch: Nor does it all appear by any the leaſt hint in Scripture that they did. Indeed our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in Commiſſionating his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, ſeems to make a difference between teaching men ſo as to make them diſciples capable of Baptiſm, and the teaching them
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:40113:15"/>afterwards how to live a truly Chriſtian Life: he ſeems to have directed them to bring them firſt to believe Chriſt to be the Son of God, the Meſſiah, the Saviour, the great Prophet that brought to men the way of Salvation, and to engage them to become diſciples unto him and his Religion, and to baptize them into it; and then afterwards to inſtruct them in the particulars of their duty: And this the double teaching mentioned in their Commiſſion, <hi>Mat. 28.19, 20.</hi> ſeems to imply, and their bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing men ſo ſuddenly and upon ſo little Teaching as they did, does likewiſe infer.</p>
            <p>I have alſo given ſame account in the Tenth Enquiry, how agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able it is to the Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:40113:16"/>of God towards men in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reſpects, to admit ſuch as have but common grace, into the Church as viſible: and if it be ſo, then they act croſs to Gods gracious deſign who labour to keep them out of it.</p>
            <p>Another miſtake upon which Separation from parochial Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is founded, is an opinion that our bleſſed Saviour has been more particular then indeed he has, in determining the external man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and circumſtances of Gods publick worſhip.</p>
            <p>For the promoters of Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were wont heretofore to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt to us from thoſe words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt, Heb. <hi>3.2. That he was faithful to him that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him, as</hi> Moſes <hi>was
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:40113:16"/>faithful in all his Houſe.</hi> That Chriſt had given direction in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular about the worſhip of God, and the orders to be obſerved in his Houſe now under the Goſpel, as <hi>Moſes</hi> had done under the Law. And accordingly they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten urged that care ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that all things be done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Pattern in the Mount. By which many people became diſaffected to the worſhip of God by the uſe of a Liturgy, in as much as they could not find our Saviour to have given any precept or direction for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping God in ſuch a way, or after ſuch manner.</p>
            <p>Whereas the faithfulneſs of Chriſt to him that had appointed him, did not ſtand in being as
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:40113:17"/>particular as <hi>Moſes</hi> was in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections touching the worſhip of God, and orders of his Houſe, but in doing and teaching ſo much and all that the Father had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him, as <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo had done. And ſince we find that our Saviour has not been ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in his directions touching theſe matters as Moſes was, we thereby know that the Father did not appoint him to be ſo, becauſe he was faithful in obſerving all that was appointed him. Now that our Saviour has not been ſo particular in his directions touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the external manner of Gods worſhip as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear if we do but compare what was done by him in this kind, and what was done by
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:40113:17"/>
               <hi>Moſes.</hi> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder the Law God did not only preſcribe the matter and ſubſtance of his worſhip, as the ſeveral ſorts of Sacrifices and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; but alſo the particular circumſtances relating to them, as the place where the Sacrifice ſhould be killed, and on which ſide the Altar, and how it ſhould be dreſſed, and about the Fire of the Altar, and the orderly laying of the Wood upon it, and how the Parts of the Sacrifice ſhould be laid upon the Wood. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this, there were Laws directing how the Prieſts ſhould be Accoutred in their Miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as of what, and after what manner and faſhion their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhould be made, and when put on, and when put off. And I
<pb n="xxxii" facs="tcp:40113:18"/>might inſtance in many like things in other caſes.</p>
            <p>But now in the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> it is far otherwiſe; There we are directed indeed in the Subſtance and Spiritual Nature of Divine Worſhip, and what is eſſential to it: But as for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal circumſtances of Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration thereof, we have very little of particular direction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; but the Church in thoſe things is left for the moſt part, to guide and determin her ſelf and her own actions by general Rules, ſuch as Edification, Peace and Order, and ſuch External ſigns of Reverence and Devotion, as Natural Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion will direct men in. And indeed there is ſo little of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular direction in theſe things,
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:40113:18"/>as that there is no ſort of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians however diſtinguiſhed, but do more, and are under a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of doing more in the External manner of Worſhip, than there is particular direction for in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
            <p>There is a command for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing Diſciples in the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt: but no particular direction what Prayer ſhall be made, or what Inſtruction ſhall be given at the Adminiſtration of Baptiſm, nor after what manner or form the Party Baptiſed ſhall by himſelf or Parents, enter into Covenant with God. The like may be ſaid touching the Lords Supper: there is no particular direction what Prayers ſhall be made, or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:40113:19"/>given, or Exhortation made at the Adminiſtration of it, nor after what manner the Elements are to be Conſecrated, otherwiſe than by reciting the words of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; nor how in particular the Cup is to be Bleſſed, nor what Geſture ſhall be uſed, nor when and how often it ſhall be Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. In theſe things Churches in ſeveral Nations may and do vary more or leſs, and yet all is well done ſo long as they keep to general Rule, which may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and kept to in theſe and other Ordinances of Worſhip under ſeveral different Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; and this none can deny.</p>
            <p>And ſo far publick Prayer, tho' we have particular Rules for the matter of it, and to whom and
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:40113:19"/>in whoſe Name to be made, and likewiſe for the Internal manner: yet as to the External manner and circumſtances (ſave that of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made in a known Tongue) as whether it ſhall be made in a ſet Form or without (except the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection given for the uſe of the Lords Prayer,) or whether with the uſe of a Book or without it, or whether kneeling or ſtanding, or how many ſhall be made at one Church Aſſembly; theſe things are not particularly determined one way or other, but are left to the prudence of men to uſe one or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, according as the exigence of Circumſtances ſhall require, or their Governors order.</p>
            <p>And if our Bleſſed Saviour had not intended to have allowed
<pb n="xxxvi" facs="tcp:40113:20"/>ſuch a liberty in the choice of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Circumſtances of Worſhip; we cannot in reaſon but think he would have been as particular in determining them, as he has been in the matter and ſubſtance of Worſhip it ſelf, which yet we ſee he has not been. For he could not but know it impoſſible for all Church Guides not immediately inſpired (tho' otherwiſe never ſo wiſe and good) to pitch upon the ſelf-ſame Circumſtances of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, where they have only general Rules to Guide them in their Choice. And accordingly experience ſhews that among good men, ſome have thought ſuch and ſuch Circumſtances of Worſhip beſt to agree with general Rules, when others as good as they have
<pb n="xxxvii" facs="tcp:40113:20"/>thought others to do ſo. And tho' in ſuch caſes both cannot be beſt under the ſame Circumſtances of things, yet that which is not beſt in it ſelf may be beſt to be uſed as Circumſtances may fall out, as when that which is not beſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be refuſed without a greater inconvenience than the uſe of that rather than a better does amount to.</p>
            <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left his People at ſo much liberty in the choice of External Circumſtances of Worſhip as we ſee he has, it argues ſufficiently that the uſe of different Circumſtantial modes of Worſhip is not at all diſpleaſing unto him, ſo long as they agree with the general Rule, eſpecially when the avoiding of a
<pb n="xxxviii" facs="tcp:40113:21"/>Breach, and the preſervation of Peace, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, and good Will in the Church, does influence the choice.</p>
            <p>If there be then ſuch a liberty left by Chriſt unto his Church of uſing different Circumſtantial modes of Worſhip, ſo long as they anſwer to the general Rule, as none can with any colour of reaſon deny but there is; then it cannot but be a great abuſe of this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for Chriſtians ſo to contend for one of theſe Circumſtantial modes of Worſhip, in oppoſition to the other, as to ſeparate and break Communion about it, and thereby to involve the Church in unpeace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtrife and contention, diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and feuds. When it is but matter of liberty to uſe one or
<pb n="xxxix" facs="tcp:40113:21"/>another, and not matter of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſable Duty to uſe one only and not the other; it cannot but be an abuſe of ſuch a liberty to make uſe of it to a publick hurt to the Church. The making uſe of that which is but only matter of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when to do ſo cauſeth a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to offend, is ſeverely condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by St. <hi>Paul;</hi> how much more then is the making uſe of ſuch li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to be blamed when it tends to a great and publick miſchief in the Church? St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>brethren, ye have been called unto liberty, onely</hi> uſe <hi>not liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for an occaſion to the fleſh, but by love ſerve one another,</hi> Gal. <hi>5.13.</hi> That the uſing of this liberty we ſpeak of has been an occaſion for the fleſh to ſhow
<pb n="xl" facs="tcp:40113:22"/>it ſelf and play its part, is ſadly viſible in that <hi>variance, ſtrife, emulation</hi> and <hi>envying,</hi> which has been cauſed thereby; which are <hi>works of the fleſh,</hi> and ſuch too that as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>they which do ſuch things ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God,</hi> Gal. <hi>5.19, 20, 21.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know it will be ſaid, that if it be an abuſe of liberty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſo much for the uſe of one External way and manner of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, when another is Lawful as well as that, and when to do ſo tends to ſtrife and diviſion, and the deſtruction of Charity; then it muſt be alike abuſe of liberty to impoſe the uſe of another, when ſuch an impoſition is attended with the ſame, or like evil or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience,
<pb n="xli" facs="tcp:40113:22"/>as we ſee the impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that preſcribed by the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy is. To this I ſhall ſay but theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> If we ſhould ſuppoſe this to be ſo as they object; yet the abuſe of a liberty one way by the Authors of ſuch an impoſition, does not at all priviledge the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of a liberty by others in the contrary extream.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> The impoſition they ſpeak of is no neceſſary <hi>Cauſe</hi> of diviſion and ſeparation, or of the ill effect of them; and if it ſhould be any <hi>occaſion</hi> of them, yet there is a vaſt difference between the being an accidental occaſion of diviſion, and actually to divide and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate cauſleſly. And look how much the one is worſe than the
<pb n="xlii" facs="tcp:40113:23"/>other, by ſo much muſt the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters be more in fault by their actual diviſion and ſeparation, than they can with any appearance of reaſon pretend the other to be, for the ſeverity of their impoſition.</p>
            <p>Now that the impoſition of the Liturgy is no neceſſary cauſe of diviſion and ſeparation, will appear in that the defects objected againſt it, are no ſufficient cauſe of ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Worſhip performed according to it: and this I hope I have made out to the ſatisfaction of any Man whoſe prejudice is not greater than his reaſon, in my inquiring into the nature of Schiſm among the following diſcourſes. In which diſcourſes I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to remove thoſe bars and ſtumbling-blocks out of the
<pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:40113:23"/>
               <hi>Diſſenters</hi> way, which have kept them from Communion with our Parochial Congregations; and this with a deſign of eaſe to them as well as ſervice to the Church otherways.</p>
            <p>But this their narrowing and leſſening the extent of the viſible Church, and the terms of admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into it, and of ſharing in the External priviledges of it; and likewiſe their confining the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of its Worſhip to one Circumſtantial mode as only Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, when Almighty God has not done ſo, is of very pernicious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. For it has we ſee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Proteſtants among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and caſt them into Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and then engaged them in contentious Diſputes one againſt
<pb n="xliv" facs="tcp:40113:24"/>another, which has begot a kind of ſtrangeneſs and ſhineſs in them towards each other, yea and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection too; and the oppoſition begot upon this account riſes ſtill higher and higher, and more and more threatens ruine to both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, firſt and laſt. And the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts themſelves could never have contrived a more likely way to diſgrace the Reformation, to lay low the Protſtant intereſt, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeble its ſtrength, and to break down its fence, and make way for the return of Popery, than we our ſelves have taken by dividing our ſelves by needleſs and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſcruples, and by making a Reformation of the Reformation as neceſſary as the firſt Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Popery was, and for
<pb n="xlv" facs="tcp:40113:24"/>want of it, to make a ſecond ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration as neceſſary as the firſt: For what would or could they do more than ſeparate, in caſe Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry were in place of Proteſtant Worſhip? And however an emendation in ſome things of an Eccleſiaſtical concern may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry convenient and deſirablee when it can be had in a <hi>Legal</hi> way; yet to make this as neceſſary as the firſt Reformation from Popery was, and a ſeparation from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial Communion for want of it, as neceſſary as our firſt ſeparation from Popery was, is ſo unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that it is a marvelous thing that men of any reputation for Wiſdom ſhould not ſee it, and be full of the ſenſe of it. And ſo it is likewiſe that they ſhould run
<pb n="xlvi" facs="tcp:40113:25"/>ſo deſparate a hazzard as they do, of loſing all the benefit they have of the National Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Popery, rather than be denied or want that further Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation as they eſteem it, which they deſire: And is it not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous alſo that they will not do what they can do toward prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, by complying with publick Order as far as they can? For they themſelves have given occaſion to believe that very many, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the more knowing of them, can joyn in the <hi>Common Prayers</hi> made in our Parochial Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, yea and more than ſo; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it comes to paſs they refrain from doing ſo. And one would think the Apoſtles injunction; <hi>if it be doſſible, and as much as in
<pb n="xlvii" facs="tcp:40113:25"/>you lies live peaceably with all men,</hi> ſhould weigh more with them than any politick conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatſoever; eſpecially when the Publick Peace and Safety is ſo much concerned in it as it is, and as they know it is. It is hardly to be believed that they can think that not to comply as far as they can, ſhould be a more likely way to come into their End, fo far as it is fair and reaſonable, than to do ſo is. God Almighty grant the things which belong to our Peace, may not ſtill be hid from our Eyes.</p>
            <p>I have been informed and do perceive that many of the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters can come to Church, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="xlviii" facs="tcp:40113:26"/>not kneel in receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; by reaſon whereof they are obnoxious to the Law, tho' they ſhould come to Church. For whoſe help and ſatisfaction in this Caſe I ſhall here add a few words which were omitted in a more proper place. One reaſon of this ſcruple of theirs is taken from our Saviour and his Apoſtles uſing another geſture at the firſt Inſtitution of the Lords Supper; But it muſt be conſidered,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> That if the circumſtances attending the firſt Inſtitution of this Supper ſhould oblige us to an imitation of them as well as in what is Eſſential to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it ſelf, then we may not receive it but in the Night, and after another Supper is firſt
<pb n="xlix" facs="tcp:40113:26"/>eaten, and in the Geſture and Poſture of lying upon Couches or Beds: for under thoſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances it was firſt inſtituted and received. But now the different Practice of Chriſtians in after times does declare, That they have not held themſelves obliged to imitate them in theſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Nor is there any reaſon they ſhould; becauſe theſe things were but accidental to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it ſelf, and were all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by this Supper, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted at the Paſchal Supper, and from the <hi>Jews</hi> Geſture uſed therein according to the Cuſtome of their Countrey. And the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Geſture does no more alter the Nature of the Ordinance; than the alteration of the other
<pb n="l" facs="tcp:40113:27"/>Accidental Circumſtances does.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Scripture Examples are no farther binding to us than they were agreeable to ſome Precept or Rule of Duty otherwiſe. But now there is no Precept enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any one Geſture to be uſed in receiving the Sacrament, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of any other, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any may be made uſe of when required by the Government over us: for where there is no Law, there is no Tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p>But if there had been any one Geſture required by our Saviour as neceſſary and as excluſive of others, no doubt but St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have made mention of it when he made known to the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> what he had received from the Lord touching
<pb n="li" facs="tcp:40113:27"/>his Laſt Supper; but we ſee no ſuch thing was mentioned by him. Chap. <hi>11.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church having altered the Geſture in their eating the Paſſeover from what was uſed at the firſt inſtitution of it; our Saviour we ſee complyed there with and conformed to what was then become Cuſtomary in that Church: And if we do the like for the like reaſon, who can blame us for it without reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Bleſſed Saviour.</p>
            <p>Their other reaſon of their Scruple, is taken from the Papiſts having abuſed this Geſture of kneeling to Idolatry in worſhipping the Bread by it? for which cauſe they ſay we ſhould not uſe it in receiving the Sacrament, leaſt we
<pb n="lii" facs="tcp:40113:28"/>ſeem to ſympolize with them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. In Anſwer to this, ſeveral things are to be conſidered. As</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> That tho' the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth ſtrictly enjoyn kneeling at the Elevation of the Hoſt, yet in the Act of Receiving it is not required by any Cannon or Conſtitution of theirs. Dr. <hi>John Burges,</hi> of great Note in his time, in his Treatiſe touching the Lawfulneſs of receiving the Sacrament kneeling, or in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the three Innocent Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, Chap. <hi>21.</hi> pag. <hi>67.</hi> and pag. <hi>479.</hi> of his Rejoynder, as he is recited (for I have not his Book) hath theſe words. <hi>With us the Biſhops or Miniſters Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate kneeling, as well as the People: But with the
<pb n="liii" facs="tcp:40113:28"/>Papiſts, the Pope when himſelf performeth the Office, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth ſitting as being a Type of Chriſt, the Maſs Prieſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſtanding by the Canon of the Maſs. For confirmation of all which he cites ſeveral Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors. He denies not but that the People receive kneeling, and ſays that the Prieſt did ſo too untill the Doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation begot the Canon for his ſtanding. But he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that kneeling in the very time of receiving, was ever in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>any Rite of, or for Adoration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament it ſelf: and ſays, never any Pope enjon'd it, nor is there any direction in the Maſs for it.</hi> The Reverend Dr. <hi>Stilliigfleet</hi>
               <pb n="liv" facs="tcp:40113:29"/>hath aſſerted much to the ſame effect in his <hi>Unreaſonableneſs of Separation.</hi> Pag. <hi>15.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> How or after what manner ſoever kneeling has been abuſed by the Papiſts to bad purpoſes, yet the abuſe of a thing otherwiſe lawful in it ſelf, does not make the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of it unlawful when ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from that abuſe. Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is abuſed by the Papiſts in their Prayers to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and other Saints, but this does not make the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of kneeling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful in our Prayers to Almighty God.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> Our receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment kneeling in complyance with Publick Order and Authority, can be no appearance or cauſe of Suſpicion of <hi>Bread-Worſhip,</hi>
               <pb n="lv" facs="tcp:40113:29"/>becauſe the ſame Authority which requires our kneeling therein, has declared in the <hi>Rubrick</hi> at the end of the Office of Communion, <hi>That no Adoration is thereby intended, or ought to de done to the Bread and Wine, or to any Corporal Preſence of Chriſts Natural Fleſh and Blood, but is intended and meant for a ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and grateful Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, of the beneſits of Chriſt therein given.</hi> By this we ſee all appearance and ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of requiring kneeling in order to any Bread-Worſhip, is quite taken away.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> Standing is a Geſture of Adoration as well as kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Mark xi. 25.</hi> and yet the Diſſenters do not think

And if its being a Geſture of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration be no juſt exception againſt the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of it in receiving the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, then the Adoration ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed or implyed in the Geſture of kneeling, can be no juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of that Geſture neither, in the performance of the ſame Duty.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5.</hi> Kneeling its being a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of Adoration is ſo far from making the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of it unlawful in receiving the Sacrament, as that it is the great reaſon why it is not unlawful but fit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient. For no good Chriſtian will deny but that it highly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us inwardly to Adore our Bleſſed Saviour in the Act of
<pb n="lvii" facs="tcp:40113:30"/>receiving the Bread and Wine, for his wonderful love in dying for us, and for giving his Fleſh for the Life of the world, and if ſo, then it cannot be incongruous or unfit to expreſs and ſignifie this internal Act of Adoration, by another that is external; for we are to Worſhip and Glorifie him both in our Bodies and our Spirits.</p>
            <p>And now me thinks no man atho underſtands and conſiders theſe things, ſhould be able to think it <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful to kneel in receiving the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of our Bleſſed Saviour.</p>

            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:40113:34"/>
            <p>My preſent deſign therefore, which I intend to purſue in theſe Papers, is, to inquire into the true meaſure which the holy Scripture gives us of theſe things, that thereby we may the more ſteadily, and with the more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty make a true Judgment of thoſe ſeparations in Church-Communion, which have been made and applauded by ſome.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin with what concerns the being of the Univerſal Church as Viſible, and then inquire how, and by what means men become Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it. After this, I ſhall inquire further what it is that qualifies men for, and which gives them a right to external Communion in this Church, as exerciſed in particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and likewiſe into the nature of Catholick-communion and Schiſm, and the uſefulneſs of National-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, for the furtherance of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion.</p>

               <head>QUERY I. <hi>WHat is the true notion of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church as viſible?</hi>
               </head>
               <p>The Univerſal Church as Viſible, is that Body, Company, or Society of People throughout the whole World, which conſiſts of all ſuch as are <hi>Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Joyned or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited to God in Chriſt as Head, by a Religious Bond.</hi> And that which doth diſtinguiſh them from all other People in the World, is that <hi>Relation</hi> they bear to God different from that in which all other People ſtand related to Him. And this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is a <hi>Religious</hi> relation, by which they are brought nearer to God than all other People are. All other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are related as humane Creatures to God as their Creator and Governour; but theſe are related to him by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of Bond &amp; Obligation, ſuch as is <hi>Spiritual and of a Religious Nature,</hi> of which I am to ſay more afterward.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:40113:35"/>
               <p>And then as this Relation is Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Viſible, ſo that by which this Relation <hi>is effected</hi> and wrought, is ſomething <hi>Viſible alſo,</hi> which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the relation it ſelf is ſaid to be <hi>Viſible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Perſons thus Viſibly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to God in Chriſt, are not all Religiouſly Related to Him alike. Some of them are Related and United to him <hi>Internally</hi> and <hi>Inviſibly</hi> by an Inviſible Bond of Union over and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their Viſible Relation to him, by that which is viſible: When as all the reſt are Related to him only <hi>Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally;</hi> or if in any reſpect Internally alſo, yet not ſo, or by ſuch a relation as will entitle them to the internal and beſt ſort of priviledges of Gods Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſuch as Juſtification, Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Pardon and Eternal life.</p>
               <p>But yet this difference does not make this body of People which are externally one, by a Relation to God common to the whole, to become two Univerſal Churches: For <hi>all</hi> which <hi>Eſſentially</hi> belongs to the being of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40113:35"/>Univerſal Church, <hi>is not limited</hi> and reſtrained to that part of it, which in reſpect of its internal and inviſible ſtate does differ from, and excel the other; for the <hi>External Relation</hi> to God, <hi>without which</hi> the Univerſal Church does not exiſt, is common to the worſer part of it as well as the better, by reaſon whereof, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be two Churches, and are but one.</p>
               <p>One part of the Viſible Church dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from another indeed in reſpect of Internal and Inviſible State before God; this is plain from the Scripture: But then it is as plain from thence, that as touching their External and Viſible ſtate, they are <hi>one,</hi> and that the ſame external priviledges belong to the one as to the other; of which more afterward.</p>
               <p>We have not indeed the words <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> and <hi>Inviſible</hi> uſed in Scripture, in reference to the two different ſtates of men in one and the ſame Church; but yet we have thoſe different ſtates of them ſufficiently revealed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40113:36"/>which we mean by thoſe words. I need not inſtance in Scriptures of this nature, becauſe they are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently and commonly known, and I ſhall have further occaſion to mention them afterward.</p>

               <head>QUERY II. <hi>WHat is it which prepares or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies perſons for that Relation to God in Chriſt, which makes them Viſible Members of his Church?</hi>
               </head>
               <p>There is ſomething <hi>previous</hi> to that, by which the Relation in men to God is wrought, which makes them Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Members of his Church, and which does capacitate them for it: and that is their being Externally <hi>call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by God to be of the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: Perſons lare firſt to become Diſciples, before they be received into the Church by Baptiſm; and their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Diſciples, and their being called, is the ſame thing. This is the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40113:36"/>foundation in which that Relation is laid, and upon which that which does effect it, is built. And People are thus called, either</p>
               <p n="1">1. When they are <hi>Converted</hi> from a <hi>falſe</hi> Religion to own and profeſs the true: And thus the Pagans were call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Preaching of the Apoſtles, when they were brought to be Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: Or,</p>
               <p n="2">2. When Almighty God cauſes them to be <hi>Born,</hi> and to be <hi>Educated</hi> in the true Religion, as thoſe are who are born of Parents externally in Covenant with God. Thus the Jewiſh People from <hi>Abrahams</hi> time down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, were called to be Gods People, and to profeſs the true Religion. And accordingly they were ſtiled Gods <hi>called</hi> ones by the Prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.12. <hi>Hearken to me, O</hi> Jacob, <hi>and</hi> Iſrael <hi>my called.</hi> And how were they called? <hi>Abraham</hi> indeed he was called <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily,</hi> by God who <hi>appeared to him when he was in</hi> Meſopotamia, <hi>before he dwelt in</hi> Charran, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.2. But his Poſterity were called by being Born
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40113:37"/>to, and educated in the ſame Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which he himſelf was of; and ſo were his Childrens Children from Generation to Generation.</p>
               <p>And thus has it been in calling Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion. At the firſt erection of the Church as Chriſtian, men were <hi>extraordinarily</hi> called by the Preaching and Miracles of the Apoſtles and others; they were called and converted from the Pagan and Jewiſh Religion, to own the Chriſtian Religion. But ſince the times of firſt planting the Goſpel up and down in the World, Gods <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> and common method of calling men to the profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion has been by their Chriſtian Parents <hi>educating</hi> them in it. And indeed their being born of Parents in an eſpecial Relation to God, is in it ſelf a <hi>Providential Call</hi> which qualifies them for the priviledge of being ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated alſo. For upon that account they are both in the Old Teſtament and the Now, ſtiled a <hi>holy Seed,</hi> that is, a Seed ſeparated from the Infidel
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40113:37"/>World to God: And by this the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males of the Jews became Church-Members, and by this were their Males qualifi'd to enter into Covenant with God by Circumciſion, at eight days old. But of theſe things further mention will be made in the proceſs of our Inquiries.</p>

               <head>QUERY III. <hi>WHat may that be by which People are made Viſible Church-Members?</hi>
               </head>
               <p>That by which People are conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted compleatly Viſible Church-Members, <hi>is a mutual Covenanting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and them,</hi> between Chriſt and his Viſible Members. In which Covenant, God on his part, promiſeth to be their God in Chriſt, to pardon them, and to confer eternal life on them, upon condition they take him only for their God, and Chriſt Jeſus for their Lord and Saviour, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in him, and obeying him. And
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40113:38"/>men on their part Covenant to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the <hi>Condition</hi> of Gods Covenant in taking him for their God, and Chriſt for their Lord and Saviour, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in him, and obeying him. Thoſe words, <hi>I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a People,</hi> contain the ſubſtance of the Covenant of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, both on Gods part, and mans part, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. The mutual Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant between God and his <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old is thus deſcribed: <hi>Thou haſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouched this day the Lord to be thy God, and to walk in his ways, and to keep his Statutes, and his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and his judgments and to hearken to his Voice And the Lord hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouched thee this day to be his peculiar People, as he hath promiſed thee, and that thou ſhouldeſt keep all his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> Deut. 26 17, 18.</p>
               <p>This mutual Covenanting is the <hi>Copulative,</hi> or Bond by which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction is made between the Head and his Members, Chriſt and his Body the Church: For the nature of it, is to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite</hi> the Parties Covenanting, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40113:38"/>to convey a mutual intereſt in each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>I entred into Covenant with thee, and thou becameſt mine,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.8. And this tying or knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together by Covenant, is called the <hi>Bond of the Covenant,</hi> Ezek. 20.37. I might multiply places, to ſhew, that mens being <hi>joyned</hi> to the Lord in the common notion of Scripture, is by <hi>Covenanting</hi> with him to be his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Thus <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.5. <hi>Come let us joyn our ſelves to the Lord in a perpetual Covenant, never to be forgotten.</hi> Alſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.6. <hi>The Sons of the Stranger, that joyn themſelves to the Lord, to ſerve him, to love the name of the Lord, and to be his Servants, every one that taketh hold of my Covenant,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>That this Union is thus made by Contract and Covenant between God and men, we may the rather believe, and the more eaſily conceive, becauſe the Holy Scripture delights to reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and illuſtrate the Union between God and his People, Chriſt and his Church, by the Union that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Men and their Wives, which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40113:39"/>is an Union by mutual Contract and Covenanting, the one to take the Woman for his Wife, the other to take the man for her Husband, with promiſe to deport themſelves towards each other, according to the nature of the mutual relation between them, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.28. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.5. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19. And thoſe who were <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the Covenants of promiſe,</hi> were ſaid to be <hi>without God, and without Chriſt;</hi> that is not related to him, nor he to them, as his Church and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.12.</p>
               <p>And here let it be obſerved and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred once for all, that the ſame thing which Unites men to Chriſt, Unites them to thoſe alſo who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready one with him by Covenant. Union with the Head, is the Reaſon of Union with all thoſe Members which make the body of that head; like as a man by becoming a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Servant to a Maſter, becomes a Member of that Family, and a Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant to all the reſt of the Servants of that Maſter.</p>

               <head>QUERY IV. <hi>HOw and when is the Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and men entred into, by which People are externally <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited to Chriſt, and viſibly made Members of his Church?</hi>
               </head>
               <p>This Covenanting is tranſacted when People are <hi>Baptized.</hi> For Baptiſm is a Sacred <hi>Rite</hi> inſtituted by Chriſt, by which the Covenant we ſpeak of, is ſolemnly entred into.</p>
               <p>As for Almighty God, he has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented men on his part, in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting with them, and ſtands open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared in his Word, to be a God to all thoſe, to pardon and ſave them, whoever they be, that ſhall become a People unto him, by believing in him, and ſerving him: And not only ſo, but he has alſo <hi>Authorized</hi> his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to tranſact with men in his Name, <hi>according to that declaration,</hi> by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into Covenant with him by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40113:40"/>Baptiſm, and thereby to receive them into his Church: For to that end are the <hi>keys</hi> of the Kingdom of Heaven delivered to them, <hi>viz.</hi> to open the door, and to let ſuch into the Church; and this they do as Stewards of God's Houſe.</p>
               <p>Now whenever men take hold on this Covenant of God, and openly and publickly Covenant with him to become a People unto him, and to perform the condition of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them, in order to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the benefits promiſed on his part, then and by that means is their viſible Relation to God, to Chriſt, and to his Church, conſtituted and made. And all this a being viſibly Baptized in his Name, doth imply.</p>
               <p>For this I conceive is the meaning of their being Baptized into the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. Not only that they are Baptized <hi>in</hi> their name, as that ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies its being done by their <hi>Authority,</hi> but alſo <hi>into</hi> their name, as that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies their being brought into a <hi>ſpecial
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40113:40"/>Relation</hi> to them as then God, whom they Covenant to worſhip and ſerve. And therefore from thenceforth they are called by that name into which they are Baptized; like as a Wife is called by the name of her Husband, from that very moment in which the Marriage-Covenant is compleated, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.1.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>That as many as have been Baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3.27. For by that they put on his Name, and put on their Relation to him. For this <hi>Viſible Memberſhip</hi> we ſpeak of, is nothing elſe but a <hi>Viſible Relation</hi> to Chriſt the Head of Chriſtians, and to all thoſe that are viſily related to him. By Baptiſm they are <hi>planted</hi> into Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. which is another me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor by which our External Union with Chriſt by Baptiſm is ſignified. And by it they are <hi>Baptized into one body,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.13.</p>
               <p>Thoſe words of St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſhew like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that there was a Covenanting with God in Baptiſm, when he ſays,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40113:41"/>
                  <hi>The like figure whereunto Baptiſm doth now ſave us, not the putting away the filth of the fleſh, but the anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God, by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.21. I find that which is here tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, <hi>The anſwer of a good Conſcience,</hi> is rendred by others, the <hi>promiſe</hi> or ſtipulation of a good Conſcience, and by ſome the <hi>queſtion</hi> or <hi>queſtioning</hi> of a good Conſcience. Now if the Greek will bear or countenance theſe ſeveral readings, <hi>Anſwer, Stipulation, Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning,</hi> yet the matter may be thus well accommodated. The Anſwer of a good Conſcience here ſpoken of, was an anſwer to ſomewhat propoſed, or put queſtionwiſe to be reſolved, or anſwered to by them, who were to be Baptized; and that the Anſwer to it, was of the nature of a Promiſe, Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation or Covenant, in reference to God. As when it was propoſed, or put queſtionwiſe to the party to be Baptized, whether he did believe Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to be the Son of God, and Saviour of the World? and whether
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40113:41"/>he would reform his ſinful life, and in hope of Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt, henceforth live unto God according to his teaching in the Goſpel: The anſwer to this was aſſertory and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſory Covenant-wiſe made, <hi>viz.</hi> that he did ſo believe, and that through Gods aſſiſtance he would ſo reform, and ſo live; to the performance whereof he <hi>bound himſelf</hi> by being Baptized in his name.</p>
               <p>Now when ſuch a promiſſory anſwer as this proceeded from ſuch a frame of mind as did produce, or would produce effects ſutable to ſuch an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer or undertaking, it might very well be called the anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God. And St. <hi>Peter</hi> might well ſay, as here we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he does, That the entrance into the Church by Baptiſm, when accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with this anſwer of a good Conſcience, would as certainly be Salvation to them through the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Jeſus Chriſt, as ever <hi>Noah</hi> &amp; his Families enterance into the Ark, was the means of their eſcaping periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40113:42"/>by water, that being the figure to which St. <hi>Peter</hi> here likens Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>And this way and method of bringing Perſons into the Viſible Church as <hi>Inſtitutive,</hi> by Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with God in Baptiſm, does but anſwer to what was done in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> days and after, for the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God a Viſible Church out of the World; for that was done by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion then, which is done by Baptiſm now. For it was the <hi>Sacred Rite</hi> of entering Perſons into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, to take God for their God, and to be his People, and for that reaſon it is called <hi>the Covenant of Circumciſion,</hi> by St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> Act. 7. And it was the badge by which they were marked and differenced from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as belonging to God by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and is therefore ſaid to be the <hi>token</hi> of the Covenant between God and them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.11. And juſt ſo is Baptiſm now, which is come in the room of Circumciſion.</p>
               <p>We ſee then how excellently the Old and New Teſtament agree in this
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40113:42"/>point: That ever ſince God has had a Viſible Church on Earth by <hi>Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> he has made the way and means of becoming Members of it to be a Covenanting with him by an initiating Ordinance.</p>

               <head>QUERY V. <hi>HOW can Infants become Viſible Church-Members by Covenanting with God, ſince they ſeem naturally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of doing ſuch a thing while In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants?</hi>
               </head>
               <p>This Inquiry ſeems neceſſary in this place upon occaſion of the reſolution of the former Query. That the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of the Circumciſed were to be engaged to God Covenant-wiſe by being Circumciſed, is paſt diſpute. But then there will another queſtion ariſe, and that is, whether they were ſo by their own act and deed, or by the act and deed of their Parents?</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:40113:43"/>
               <p>We cannot ſay that they were in their own Perſons <hi>active</hi> in Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with God; and that therefore it muſt needs be by the act and deed of their Parents, that they were by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion engaged to God Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.

               </p>
               <p>And the Anſwer is, that there can be no doubt but that they were, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing they were obliged at all, which none deny but they were. The Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were obliged by what their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents did in their Minority on their behalf, with a purpoſe to oblige them, ſuppoſing the thing lawful. This was a thing commonly underſtood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews, and taken for granted, and as it appears, was ſo accounted by God alſo. I will give ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of both.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Jews did ſo eſteem it, and that appears by what they did to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40113:43"/>their Seed after them to obſerve the days of Purim. <hi>Eſther</hi> 9.27. <hi>The</hi> Jews <hi>ordained and took upon them, and upon their Seed, and upon all ſuch as joyned themſelves unto them, ſo as it ſhould not fail that they would keep theſe two days according to their writing, and according to their appointed time every year: and that theſe days ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred and kept throughout every Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, every Family, every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and every City, and that theſe days of Purim ſhould not fail from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the</hi> Jews, <hi>nor the remembrance of them periſh from their Seed.</hi> So again, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.42. <hi>And</hi> Jonathan <hi>ſaid to</hi> David, <hi>Go in peace, for as much as we have ſworn both of us in the Name of the Lord, ſaying, The Lord be between me and thee, and between my Seed and thy Seed for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Almighty God did account and hold the Children obliged by what their Parents did, or had done on their behalf, with an intent to oblige them. For proof of this, I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in ſeveral caſes.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:40113:44"/>
               <p>Firſt, the Lord did hold the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Poſterity of the <hi>Jews</hi> to be obliged by that Covenant which their Fore-fathers had made with the <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beonites</hi> in the days of <hi>Joſhua.</hi> For there was three years of Famine ſent by God in the days of <hi>David,</hi> for that <hi>Saul</hi> and his Houſe had ſlain the <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beonites,</hi> contrary to the Covenant which their Fore-fathers had made with them, tho it was ſeveral hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of years before, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.1.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Men, Women, and <hi>their little ones</hi> entred into Covenant with God, by his appointment, in the <hi>Land of Moab,</hi> Deut. 29.10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>Ye ſtand this day all of you before the Lord your God—your little Ones and your Wives—that thou ſhouldeſt enter into Covenant with the Lord thy God.</hi> And it muſt be by the act of their Parents ſince, or ſome in their ſtead, that their little Ones did ſo, by obliging them as much as in them lay, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and keep that Covenant when they ſhould come to years of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40113:44"/>to underſtand it. For it is not eaſie to underſtand how the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Ones that were but Infants, could otherwiſe enter into Covenant with God. And if not, then we ſee from this inſtance likewiſe, that God did account the little Children obliged by what their Parents did on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half with an intent to oblige them. Which is yet farther confirmed from what is ſaid in the 14. and 15. verſes, in theſe words. <hi>Neither with you on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do I make this Covenant, and this Oath; but with him that ſtandeth here with us this day before the Lord our God, and alſo with him that is not here with us this day;</hi> meaning their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity yet to come, as is generally underſtood. For it ſeems that God did intend to oblige the Poſterity to come, to take him for their God, by bringing their Fore-fathers into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him. Hence it is that the <hi>Jews</hi> defection to Idolatry is ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated thus; <hi>They rejected his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and his Covenant which he made with their Fathers,</hi> 2 King. 17.15.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40113:45"/>And in this 29. of <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. <hi>Then ſhall men ſay, becauſe they have forſaken the Covenant of the Lord God of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the Land of</hi> Aegypt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How could that have aggravated their crime, in not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Covenant conſented to by their Fore-fathers, unleſs they their Poſterity had been obliged by their Fore-fathers conſenting to it?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God calls thoſe Children of Idolatrous Jews, <hi>his</hi> Children, whom they Sacrificed to their Idols, and ſays, <hi>they were born unto him,</hi> Ezek. 16.20, 21. &amp; 23.37. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what account were they ſo, but by being the Children of Parents in Covenant with God, tho now they had violated it, and by being farther brought into Covenant with God by their Parents Circumciſing them? It ſeems that Covenant which had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged the Parents to be Gods, obliged thoſe that were born of them to be ſo likewiſe, and much more were they thus obliged, when their Parents had
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40113:45"/>brought them into Covenant with God by Circumciſing them. Tho ſuch Parents had forfeited their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-<hi>intereſt</hi> in God, yet they had not by that, by which they did ſo, made void Gods Covenant-<hi>right</hi> to them and their Children, but that they were ſtill under an Obligation to him to be his. Upon which account it is, as it is probable, that God is called the God of ſome men, when yet they have been very bad, as we may ſee, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 15.3. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16.2. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.5. &amp; 36.5.12.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It was the Parents that Circumciſed their Children of eight days old, and not the Children them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and yet theſe Children were as firmly obliged by it, when grown to be men, as if they had then Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed themſelves. <hi>I teſtifie again to every man that is Circumciſed, that he is a debtor to do the whole Law,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 5.3.</p>
               <p>And if they were obliged by what their Parents did in Circumciſing them, to perform the duty on their
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40113:46"/>part, whenever they were capable of it; we may well conceive that by what their Parents did in entring them into Covenant by Circumciſing them, they were inveſted with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit promiſed on Gods part, until they deveſted themſelves of it by their actual and wilful tranſgreſſing the Covenant, in not becoming a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unto God, in correſpondence to his Promiſe of being a God unto them.</p>
               <p>And the truth is according to Scripture account, little Children, which were devoted to the Service of God by their Parents, and deſigned to be trained up to it, were by a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable conſtruction reputed to be doers of that Service while but little Children, which they could not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally perform until they were paſt their Child-hood. This is plain and expreſs in one caſe, and by purity of reaſon, muſt be allowed in other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der like circumſtances. The Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the <hi>Koathites,</hi> of a month old, were ſaid to <hi>keep the charge of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40113:46"/>Sanctuary,</hi> becauſe they were deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and devoted for it by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents then, tho they could not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally perform that Service until they attained unto more years, <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.27, 28. <hi>Theſe are the Families of the</hi> Koathites, <hi>in the number of all the Males from a month old and upwards, were eight thouſand and ſix hundred, keeping the charge of the Sanctuary.</hi> And the contrary practice of Parents was accompanied with a contrary e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in their Children: If they did not devote their Children to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God by Circumciſing them when they ſhould, their Children were reputed breakers of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, whereas their Parents properly were ſo, by neglecting to fulfil the terms of it on their Childrens behalf. <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſed Man-child, whoſe fleſh of his fore-skin is not Circumciſed, that ſoul ſhall be cut off from his People; he hath broken my Covenant,</hi> Gen. 17.14.</p>
               <p>And thus were the little Children of Proſelytes alſo made parties in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40113:47"/>Gods Covenant by their Fathers taking hold of it, and by entering their Male-Children with themſelves into it by Circumciſion, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48.</p>
               <p>Nor is it at all unreaſonable that the Children ſhould be obliged by what their Parents did to that end in their Minority, ſo long as it was in nothing but what the Children ought then to have obliged themſelves to, if they had been capable to have done ſo, and which in duty they ought to oblige themſelves to, when come to years of diſcretion, if their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents had not done it for them before. Parents, as Parents, have ſo great an Intereſt and Propriety in their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſo great Authority over them, and Power of diſpoſing of them, that what they oblige them to by their act and deed, will, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, in their Minority, they ought in duty to obſerve and do; if the things be not unreaſonable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor countermanded by God, as having a greater Intereſt in them,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40113:47"/>and Authority over them than their Parents had. This is ſo reaſonable, as that we ſee God himſelf approves of it, and has founded his own Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution upon it, of obliging little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by Covenanting with him by the act and deed of their Parents. If a man by his Will and Teſtament, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige his Son and Heir to any thing which is fair and reaſonable, it is a diſhonourable thing among men for ſuch a Child to eſteem himſelf not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged thereby to do it. <hi>If it be but a mans Covenant or Teſtament, yet if it be confirmed, no man diſannulleth it,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 3.15.</p>
               <p>And thus we ſee how little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren become obliged in Covenant with God, and viſible Members of his Church, by the act and deed of their Parents on their behalf, both before the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> and under it.</p>
               <p>Let us now conſider whether the little Children of Chriſtians under the New Teſtament, be not brought into Covenant with God, and made Members of the viſible Church by
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40113:48"/>the act and deed of their Parents, as well, and as much as others had been in times of the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>It cannot be denied but that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian-Parents have as great a Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in, and as much Authority over their Children now, as ever Parents had under the Law: And if ſo, they muſt needs be in the ſame capacity of obliging their little Children by their act and deed on their behalf, in any thing that is for their benefit, as they were. Nor is it leſs the duty of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren now to be obliged by what their Parents do in their Minority on their behalf for their benefit, than it was then. <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> is of as much force to Children now, as ever it was in Old Teſtament times. Theſe things are clearly ſeen by the light of nature. And now we deny not but that it is as much the duty of Parents now, to ſeek the good of their Children, by doing that for them in their Minority, which tends to their benefit, as ever it was heretofore.</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:40113:48"/>
               <p>All things being ſuppoſed it muſt be granted, that Parents are in as good a capacity to oblige their little Children to God in Covenant now, by what they may do on their behalf in their Minority, as ever Parents were heretofore. They may dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and devote them to God and his Service by Baptiſm now, as well as Parents could by Circumciſion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore. And Baptiſm does as much oblige the Baptized in Covenant with God now, as ever Circumciſion did the Circumciſed heretofore. And it is now as much the benefit of Perſons to be obliged in Covenant with God in their Infancy by Baptiſm, as ever it was for others formerly by Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.</p>
               <p>Now as touching that Warrant or Authority which Chriſtians have to oblige their Infant Children by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them, to become parties in Gods Covenant, and to perform the terms and condition of it on their part, as they grow up into a capacity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing active therein, I ſhall compare
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40113:49"/>what of this kind Chriſtians have, with what <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, and others had for their obliging their Children to be a People unto God by Circumciſing them. <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed had an expreſs command for it, but the Gentiles, which were not of <hi>Abrahams</hi> natural Seed, had only a favourable allowance and grant, that in caſe any of them had a mind to joyn themſelves to the Jewiſh Church, and to have communion with them in the way of worſhip preſcribed them,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 12 48.</note> that then in order to this attainment, the Father, or Man himſelf was to be Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, and all his Males. But o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, as Circumciſion was not enjoyned the Gentiles, ſo we do not find that any Prophet or other, were ſent abroad among them, to draw them into the Jewiſh Church; only we read indeed that the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees <hi>compaſſed Sea and Land to make one Proſelyte,</hi> but its probable it was but from among other Jews, to make him of their Sect, to ſtrengthen their party.</p>

               <p>But when the Viſible Church was to become Chriſtian, our Saviour commiſſionated his Apoſtles <hi>to go into all the World, and to diſciple all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Baptize them.</hi> Now if this commiſſioning extended to the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing the little Children of Chriſtian Parents, as well as the Chriſtian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents themſelves; then here is War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and Authority enough for ſuch Parents to engage their Children by Baptizing them in Covenant with God, and to oblige them to perform the terms of it when they ſhall be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of endeavouring to do ſo.</p>
               <p>And that this Commiſſion of our Saviour did extend to the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing the Apoſtles to Baptize ſuch little Children, I have endeavoured to make out in another diſcourſe which I ſhall not here repeat, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Reader to it. [<hi>Addreſs</hi> from <hi>p.</hi> 29. to <hi>p.</hi> 80.] The ſubſtance of what is there ſaid, is reducible to theſe two heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To ſhew what reaſon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles had to underſtand the words
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40113:50"/>of their Commiſſion to Baptize in this Latitude.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What reaſon we have to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they did underſtand the words of their Commiſſion in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive ſenſe, and that they did pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice accordingly.</p>
               <p>Unto what I have ſaid there, I ſhall here add one very conſiderable reaſon to induce us to believe that the Apoſtles did Baptize the little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Chriſtians, taken from the unanimous agreement of all Chriſtians in all parts of the World, in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Baptizing Infants in the purer times of the Church, and before the defection into Popery. Now there are ſome things which render it <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally impoſſible,</hi> that there ſhould be ſuch an unanimous agreement in ſuch a practice, unleſs they had it from the Apoſtles, or others ſent by them, in their firſt planting of Chriſtianity in thoſe places.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles went into all the World to Preach the Goſpel, and were our Saviours <hi>Witneſſes unto the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40113:50"/>uttermoſt parts of the earth,</hi> according to his Commiſſion. <hi>Their ſound went into all the Earth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 10. Col. 1.6.23.</note> 
                  <hi>and their words unto the ends of the World: The Goſpel was Preached to every Creature under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith. There are ſome things which make it morally impoſſible that there ſhould be ſuch an univerſal agreement as aforeſaid in all places, upon any other account, or for any other reaſon than their firſt receiving this practice of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing Infants, from the Apoſtles, in their firſt planting of Chriſtianity there. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. The vaſt <hi>diſtance of one place</hi> from another, where the Chriſtians lived, made it morally impoſſible they ſhould come into this uſage by combination, or imitation of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>diverſity</hi> of their <hi>Languages</hi> made it impoſſible that this ſameneſs of practice ſhould grow out of any mutual correſpondence, or intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence held by them.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:40113:51"/>
               <p n="3">3. If theſe things had not made it impoſſible, and if it could be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that the Chriſtians in all parts, notwithſtanding their diſtance of place, and diverſity of Language, might have held ſuch correſpondence as by agreement to have introduced ſuch a practice as they had not from the Apoſtles, but had been impoſed upon them at firſt by ſome <hi>Innovators;</hi> yet it is morally impoſſible it ſhould ſteal into all Churches, and every where, without ſome <hi>known oppoſition</hi> from ſome good men or other, if it had not been Apoſtolical.</p>
               <p>We cannot with any reaſon think that all Chriſtians both in office, and out of office in the Church, would have ſuffered ſuch an Innovation as this (if it had been an Innovation) without ſuch conſiderable oppoſition as would have been taken notice of by ſome Author or other, who lived in or near ſuch time in which it had been firſt brought into the Church.</p>
               <p>Since then no man is able to aſſign the beginning of this practice ſhort of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40113:51"/>the Apoſtles times: And ſince the whole world of Chriſtians were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in it, in the pureſt times of the Church, for ought appears to the contrary: And ſince all Chriſtians, how much ſoever they have differed in other things, have yet all along a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in this, as much as they have in the obſervation of the Lords day, a very few only excepted, and thoſe chiefly, or rather only, as have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſince <hi>Luthers</hi> days, or the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi> of the <hi>Reformation:</hi> And ſince the Apoſtles practice recorded in Scripture of their Baptizing whole Houſholds, gives us ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they practiſed the ſame in all places where they have been, and that their doing ſo, was the reaſon and ground of the univerſal practice of Baptizing Infants in all Churches firſt planted by them, and in thoſe ſucceeding them: I ſay all theſe things conſidered, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains little reaſon for any impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial man to doubt, but that the Apoſtles did practiſe Infant Baptiſm
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40113:52"/>in purſuance of their Commiſſion.</p>

               <head>QUERY VI. <hi>WHether in the Baptizing of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that method of proceeding be not moſt proper, by which the Children are moſt directly made to enter into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God by their Parents?</hi>
               </head>
               <p>The reaſon of this Query ariſes out of the matters diſcuſſed in the two former. For if that Union and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between God and men, by which they become Members of his Viſible Church, is made by entering into Covenant with him, to be his People, as he with them to be their God: And if little Children are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged in Covenant with God, by what their Parents do in cauſing them to be Baptized with intent thereby ſo to oblige them; then I propoſe it to be conſidered, whether it will not thence follow that it is moſt proper to demand of the Parents, whether
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40113:52"/>in bringing their Children to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, they do not intend thereby to dedicate them to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and to engage them as much as in them lies, to be Gods faithful Servants, and to believe and live according to the Doctrine and Precepts of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt? or ſomewhat to that effect. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther likewiſe ſuch Anſwers from the Parents ſhould not be expected, as are moſt ſuitable to ſuch demands?</p>
               <p>And further, it would be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, Whether Infants can be ſo well, or ſo directly and properly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to God in Covenanting with him in Baptiſm, by what Sponſors, which are not their Parents, then do to oblige them, as they may by what their Parents themſelves may do to that end.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon of this propoſal or queſtion is this: If the Childrens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged to do that when they come to Age, which Parents obliged them to in their Baptiſm, does depend upon their Parents properly in them,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40113:53"/>and authority over them, as is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it does from what has been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly argued; then they cannot be ſo properly obliged by what other Sponſors do in their behalf at their Baptiſm, which have no ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in them, or authority over them.</p>
               <p>It is true indeed, Parents are not wholly unconcerned in entering their Children into Covenant with God by Baptiſm, when yet Sponſors act in the Parents ſtead: For it is the Parents that cauſe their Children to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and what the Sponſors act, is by the Parents procurement; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe accounts it is interpretative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their act: But yet Parents imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and in their own perſons act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the part of entering their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren into Covenant, ſeems more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and better to anſwer the nature of the things. Sponſors may be more uſeful in caſe Parents of Children to be Baptized are dead, as poſſibly it might be the caſe of ſome Children, whoſe Parents were Martyr'd in the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40113:53"/>Primitive times, from which perhaps that uſage in the Church took its firſt riſe. There are other caſes in which Sponſors or Pro-parents may be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and neceſſary, but hardly ſo as to exclude Parents from their proper work.</p>
               <p>But I ſpeak of theſe things with ſubmiſſion to thoſe of better judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and more authority, having only offered them to conſideration.</p>

               <head>QUERY VII. <hi>FOr what reaſon is Church-Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſaid to be Inviſible as well as Viſible in ſome, and yet but only as Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in others? And from whence does this difference ariſe?</hi>
               </head>
               <p>This difference proceeds from the difference there is between Viſible and Inviſible Chriſtianity, and from the different Union between Chriſt the Head, and his Members which is cauſed thereby.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:40113:54"/>
               <p>By inviſible Chriſtianity, I mean thoſe inward acts and affections of ſoul, by which men <hi>abhor that which is evil, and cleave to that which is good,</hi> which are wrought by a ſerious aſſent of the mind unto the truth of the doctrine and great motives of the Goſpel, by which they are convinced of the neceſſity of repentance and holy living, in order to their eſcaping everlaſting miſery, and becoming e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally happy.</p>
               <p>By viſible Chriſtianity, I mean ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and viſible acts of Religion, in reference both to God and men; ſuch as is the <hi>profeſſion</hi> of the God that made the World, to be the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt, whom he hath ſent, to be his Son, and the reſt of the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, and ſuch other acts as conſiſt in an external performance of the external acts of worſhip due to this God and Saviour, and in acts of Juſtice and Charity towards men, and in ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of behaviour in reference to a mans ſelf.</p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:40113:54"/>
               <p>Now by the internal and inviſible Chriſtianity forementioned, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with that which is external, the Covenant entred into in Baptiſm, is ſo performed, that by it a man is internally and inviſibly united to Chriſt, and conſequently to all thoſe who are inviſibly one with him. But viſible Chriſtianity alone, is but an external performance of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant entred into in Baptiſm; and this amounts to no more than an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and viſible Union with Chriſt, and with his Church as viſible. By this much then we may underſtand wherein the difference between vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and inviſible Church member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip lies, and from whence it doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe.</p>
               <p>Now that the internal Chriſtianity which conſiſts in an internal change in the faculties of the ſoul, to wit, in their apprehenſion, inclination, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and operations in reference to their various objects of good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, does produce or obtain an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and inviſible Union of men with
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40113:55"/>the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt, will appear if we conſider theſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This internal Renovation of ſoul contains in it an Union with God by <hi>adheſion;</hi> for by it a man doth with his heart and ſoul, and out of judgment and choice, <hi>cleave</hi> unto the Lord: which in the ſence of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a being <hi>joyned to him. He that is joyned, or he that cleaveth unto the Lord, is one ſpirit;</hi> for it is rendred by both words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. And for a man firmly and reſolvedly to adhere and ſtick to the Lord, and to the intereſt of his honour and glory in the world, in worſhipping, loving, and obeying him, and in placing his affiance in him, as his only God and Saviour, come what will (which is his cleaving to him) is ſuch a moral <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> with God, as the nature of man is capable of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This internal Renovation work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an inviſible Union with God, by <hi>a participation of the divine nature,</hi> as the Apoſtle phraſeth it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40113:55"/>By which participation, men are morally united to God. For they are thereby renewed to the Image of God, in Knowledge, Righteouſneſs, and Holineſs, and ſo are made one Spirit, or one in ſpirit with Him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord is one ſpirit,</hi> or of one ſpirit. For ſo far as ſuch an one is partaker of the Divine nature by Renovation, he judgeth of good and evil, as God judgeth, and loves and hates, and deſigns the ſame things that he doth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By this Renovation of the Inner man, men come to have the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and of Chriſt, to <hi>reſide and dwell in them,</hi> by which their <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> with the Father and the Son, is compleated. The holy Spirit firſt prepares them as living Temples, or an Habitation for himſelf to dwell in, by renewing them in a leſs degree, and then comes and takes up his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode, and dwells in them, by affording them a more conſtant, and more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40113:56"/>influence and aſſiſtance. And the ſame Spirit dwelling both in Chriſt and in them, the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them becomes more intimous and more entire. <hi>Hereby we know that we dwell in him, and he in us, becauſe he hath given us of his Spirit,</hi> 1 John 4.13. As the Union of all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a natural body is not made ſo much by their contiguity or cloſe joyning, as by being all animated by one and the ſame ſpirit which is in all the parts; ſo it is in the Union of the Head and Members of the Myſtical Body, Chriſt and the Church, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular Member of it; for they are united by the quickening power and influence of the ſame Spirit which abides both in the head and all the members.</p>
               <p>By what hath been ſaid touching the Inviſible <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> between Chriſt and his Church as Inviſible, it will be eaſie to diſcern whence and for what reaſon it is that many who are really Members of the Church as Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, are yet no more but ſuch, and not
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40113:56"/>at all of the Church as Inviſible. And it is for want of ſuch an inward change of the mind and will, and all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the ſoul, in reference to ſin and duty, good and evil, as is made by a vigorous aſſent of the mind to the great truths of the Goſpel, and the mighty motives of it, and by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and frequent conſideration of them, and how a mans own ſelf is concerned in them in point of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or miſery, according as he yields up himſelf to be governed by them, or refuſes to do ſo.</p>
               <p>I do not deny but that ſuch who are Members of the Church, but only as it is Viſible, may yet in ſome ſort really aſſent unto the truth of what the Goſpel reveals, touching Chriſt, his being the Son of God, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of Sinners; yea, touching the neceſſity of Repentance, in order to the obtaining the pardon of Sin and Eternal Life by his ſufferings. I doubt not but that theſe may in ſome ſort believe, and undiſſemblingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to believe otherwiſe concerning
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40113:57"/>the Chriſtian doctrine, than profeſs'd Infidels do, tho not ſo ſeriouſly and effectually as the truly Regenerate. We cannot ſay they properly diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whom they profeſs to believe the Chriſtian doctrine, or Articles of the Chriſtian faith: We cannot ſay their words are knowingly contrary to the ſentiment of their minds and thoughts in ſuch a profeſſion. We ſee by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that ſome Sea-faring men o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe vicious in their lives, yet when taken Captive by Infidels, will endure any hardſhip, rather than be drawn to ſay they do not believe the Chriſtian doctrine; which is a good evidence that they do in ſome ſence really believe it, tho perhaps not ſo effectually as the truly Regenerate do. There were many in our Saviours days, of whom the Scripture ſays that they did believe in Chriſt, whoſe faith yet was not powerful enough to Regenerate them. And ſuch was <hi>Simon Magus</hi> alſo; and ſuch were thoſe who as St. <hi>James</hi> ſuppoſed had faith, and yet not juſtified by it, it
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40113:57"/>Being <hi>alone,</hi> and but a <hi>dead faith;</hi> and ſuch faith is the faith, as may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be feared of many at this day, who are Chriſtians by profeſſion, and of the Viſible Church.</p>
               <p>Nay farther, I do not deny but that this faith of theirs in conjunction with ſome external motives, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a form of Godlineſs, ſo that they may do moſt of the <hi>external</hi> acts of Religion which Regenerate men do. They may enter into Covenant with God in Baptiſm, and worſhip him only, and in the name of Chriſt: They may openly own the Articles of the Chriſtian faith, and with zeal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute for them. They may frequent the Ordinances of publick worſhip; ſuch as Prayer, hearing the Word, and the Lords Supper, and may obſerve the Lords day. They may be free from groſs and ſcandalous ſins, do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny acts of juſtice in their dealing with men, and give Alms alſo. They may be thus outwardly Righteous and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally Religious, and yet be unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed as touching the inward man.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40113:58"/>They may for all this be full of Envy, Malice, Hatred, and Revengeful thoughts, of Emulation, Wrath, and Pride; of Ambition, Covetouſneſs, and Inordinate affection; which are ſins of that ſort which the Apoſtle calls <hi>works of the fleſh,</hi> and ſuch as exclude men out of the Kingdom of Heaven. And while they remain thus unrenew'd in their minds and wills; what ever faith or repentings they may otherwiſe have, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their outward performances may be, yet they fall ſhort of being of the Inviſible Church, for want of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward renovation that inviſibly unites men to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But yet tho this external Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity fore-mentioned will not make men Members of the Church Inviſible, yet it will evidence and declare them to be of the Church as viſible, and continue them in it. For it is in ſome ſort (tho but partial indeed) an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal performance of the Covenant of Baptiſm, by which they had their firſt enterance into the Viſible Church,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40113:58"/>and by which their external relation to God in a religious ſence, was firſt conſtituted. It is in reſpect of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Chriſtianity, that ſuch are ſaid to be in Chriſt, who yet are but unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful branches (<hi>John</hi> 15.) devoid of that fruit which is called the <hi>fruit of the ſpirit,</hi> which conſiſts of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal qualifications deſcribed in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22, 23. And their being <hi>in</hi> Chriſt, ſignifies an external <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> between them, which is made by external Chriſtianity. And in ſuch an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reſpect, the whole multitude of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who did not violate the bond of the Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and them, by running into Idolatry, were ſaid to <hi>cleave</hi> unto the Lord, which is another word which ſignifies their being Joyned or Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him; which can be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood but of an external Union by external Religion, in reference to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them at leaſt. Thus in <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.3, 4. it is ſaid, <hi>All the men that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Baal-peor, the Lord thy God hath deſtroy'd them from among you: but ye
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40113:59"/>that did cleave unto the Lord your God, are alive every one of you this day.</hi> Where we ſee their continuing to worſhip the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the uſe of his Ordinances, without follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Baal-peor</hi> as ſome others did, is called their <hi>cleaving</hi> unto God. And by that they continued their relation unto God uninterrupted. But of this I ſhall have occaſion to ſay more in the next inquiry.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee that it is viſible Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity that makes men to be of the Viſible Church, and Inviſible Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity which makes them to be of the Church as Inviſible. Thoſe that have viſible Chriſtianity, are thereby differenced from the Infidel and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous World on the one hand, and by their having no more, they are differenced from the Inviſible Church on the other, and thereby ſet in a middle ſtate between both, and that is in the Viſible Church.</p>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40113:60"/>the true God, were counted his Children. Natural Religion, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in point of worſhip, was then the meaſure of judging mens vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible relation to God.</p>
               <p>But when Almighty God was pleaſed to ſet on foot, and begin the gathering him a Viſible Church out of the reſt of the World in a way of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> he laid the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it in his tranſaction with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> by inſtituting and ordaining two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That as God by Covenant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to <hi>Abraham</hi> to be his God, and the God of his Seed, ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed muſt engage to God by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to be his Servants, and a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unto him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this Covenant ſhould be entred into by <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, by obſerving ſuch a Sacred Rite as God inſtituted and appointed for that purpoſe, and that was <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.</hi> And this was continued for this uſe, until the Meſſias came and inſtituted <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> another Sacred
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40113:61"/>Rite for the ſame end. Now in Gods thus founding his Viſible Church, there was no ſuch thing as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing ſaving Grace in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of charity, to be the condition of mens admiſſion into his Church by Circumciſion: But the Lord abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely commanded that <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Male Seed after him, and all Born in the Houſe, or bought with their money, ſhould be Circumciſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any limitation or condition in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the appearance of ſaving Grace. By which it is evident that God did not deſign to have no others of his Viſible Church than ſuch as had ſaving Grace.</p>
               <p>Now the Poſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> when they came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> were by virtue of their Covenanting with God, all of them bad as well as good, viſibly related to God as his People; and ſo his as no other people were. And I hope we may ſafely ſay, that <hi>God himſelf accounted them to be,</hi> what <hi>Moſes</hi> and others by <hi>divine inſpiration</hi> ſaid they were. And if ſo, then we
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40113:61"/>may ſay, that Almighty God did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them all bad as well as good (tho not in the moſt emphatical ſence) to be his <hi>choſen</hi> elected and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted People (<hi>Deut.</hi> 4.37. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4.) <hi>his Called,</hi> (Iſa. 48.12.) <hi>a People near unto him</hi> (Pſal. 148.14.) <hi>his Saints his holy People,</hi> (Deut. 7.6. &amp; 33.3. Pſal. 50.5.) <hi>his Children</hi> (Deut. 14.1.) <hi>a ſpecial and peculiar People unto himſelf,</hi> (Deut. 7.6. &amp; 14.2.) <hi>his Inheritance,</hi> (Deut. 9.29.) <hi>his Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> (Deut. 32.9.) <hi>his peculiar Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> Pſal. 135.4.</p>
               <p>All theſe Titles and Appellations given them by God, or by man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by God in giving them, do with as much plainneſs as words can expreſs, ſhew, that God himſelf own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them for his People, his Children, and related to him in ſuch a ſence as other People not in Covenant with him, were not.</p>
               <p>Now that they were not thus called or accounted for any ſuch reaſon as becauſe they had ſaving grace, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were reputed to be of the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40113:62"/>Church as Inviſible, will appear with full evidence. For the ſame inſpired Man <hi>Moſes,</hi> at the ſame time, and in the ſame Book, in and by which God owned them for his People under many of the foreſaid appellations, did from God charge them with ſuch and ſo much guilt, as no man can with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny colour of reaſon ſay was conſiſtent with an Inviſible Church-ſtate.</p>
               <p>Thus in <hi>Deut.</hi> 9. <hi>Thou art a ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necked People,</hi> verſ. 6. <hi>From the day thou didſt depart out of the Land of</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, <hi>even until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious againſt the Lord,</hi> verſ. 7. <hi>They have corrupted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they have quickly turned aſide,</hi> verſ. 12. <hi>I have ſeen this People, and behold it is a ſtiff-necked People.</hi> verſ. 13. <hi>You have been Rebellious againſt the Lord from the day that I knew you,</hi> verſ. 24. <hi>I know thy rebellion and thy ſtiff neck,</hi> chap. 31.27. <hi>They have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted themſelves, their ſpot is not the ſpot of his Children, they are a perverſe and crooked generation,</hi> chap. 32.5. <hi>When the Lord ſaw it, he abhorred them,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40113:62"/>becauſe of the provoking of his Sons, and of his Daughters,</hi> verſ. 19. <hi>A fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Generation, Children in whom is no faith,</hi> verſ. 20. <hi>They are a Nation void of Counſel, neither is there any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in them,</hi> verſ. 28.</p>
               <p>Theſe things are charged on them generally and in the groſs. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering ſome other paſſages, there is great cauſe to fuſpect that much the major part of them at leaſt were thus guilty. For in <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.2. its faid, <hi>That all the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt</hi> Moſes, <hi>and againſt</hi> Aaron; <hi>and the whole Congregation ſaid. Would God we had died in the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>or would God we had died in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.</hi> And verſ. 10. <hi>All the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation bade ſtone them with ſtones.</hi> And verſ. 33. <hi>Your Children ſhall wander in the Wilderneſs forty years, and bear your Whoredoms, until your Carcaſes be waſted in the Wilderneſs.</hi> And verſ. 35. <hi>I will ſurely do it to all this evil Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation that are gathered together againſt me.</hi> And verſ. 29. <hi>Your Carcaſes ſhall fall in this Wilderneſs; and all that are
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40113:63"/>numbred of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which have murmured againſt me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe things conſidered, they will not ſuffer us with any plauſible pretence to ſay, or to think that God owned this People in the bulk of them, as his Viſible Church, for any ſuch reaſon, as becauſe they ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be Inviſibly related to him by ſpecial grace. And if not, then it muſt be upon ſome, or all of theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts following, unleſs any other more likely can be thought of, which I am not able to foreſee, nor to ſuſpect.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They were in ſome ſort <hi>holy</hi> and ſeparated unto God, as they were <hi>Born of Parents</hi> who were <hi>in Covenant with him.</hi> Upon which account they were called a <hi>holy Seed,</hi> Ezra 9.2. Now the holineſs of perſons always ſignifies ſome ſuch ſpecial relation to God, which is not common to all perſons as ſuch. Almighty God has another kind of right to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40113:63"/>of ſuch as are his by Covenant, than he has to the Children of thoſe that are not, as indeed he is in ſome ſort more a God to ſuch Children, than he is to the Children of others. God has a Right to all Children, and is related to them, and they to him, as he is their Creator, and they his Creatures. But he has a more ſpecial right to the Children of them that are in Covenant with him, tho ſuch Parents have taken Covenant with God. And thus the Children of thoſe Jews which were offered in Sacrifice by the Parents unto their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, were claimed by God as <hi>his</hi> Children, and as <hi>Born to him,</hi> Ezek. 16.20. <hi>Thou haſt taken thy Sons and thy Daughters whom thou haſt born un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, and theſe thou haſt ſacrificed to them to be deſtroy'd.</hi> verſ. 21. <hi>Thou haſt ſlain my Children to cauſe them to paſs through the fire,</hi> chap. 23.37. <hi>They cauſed the Sons whom they bare unto me, to paſs for them through the fire.</hi> Tho theſe wicked Parents had forfeited their right to the benefits of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40113:64"/>in Gods part, through their defection from him to Idolatry, yet they had not thereby made void his right to them, and to their Children which he had by their having entred into Covenant with him to be his, and therefore he calls them <hi>his</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſays they were <hi>born unto him.</hi> And it was in this reſpect in all likelihood, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> called thoſe Children <hi>holy</hi> that had one believing Parent, tho the other were an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. The Children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came related to God in ſome fort as his (for that's the meaning of their being holy) by the Parents having devoted themſelves to God by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. How elſe could the Females among the Jews be related to God as his, when they were not Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed? By which yet the Males be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Gods by right of Covenant, and ſo his, as that their Children became his, and to be related to him in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour degree by right of birth. And in this ſence thoſe words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> may be underſtood when he ſays, <hi>If
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40113:64"/>the root be holy, ſo are the branches,</hi> Rom. 11.16. And thus <hi>Jews by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> (or by birth) are oppoſed to <hi>Sinners of the Gentiles,</hi> as Saints are oppoſed to Sinners, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.15.</p>
               <p>And we ſhall find that Almighty God did not only claim a right to the natural Seed of Jewiſh Parents, by virtue of their being in Covenant with him, but alſo a right to thoſe Strangers of which they were abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute owners, whether they were born in the houſe, or bought with money, both Fathers and their Children: and accordingly he commanded them to be mark'd for his, and to be brought into Covenant with him by Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing all the Males both Fathers and Children, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.12, 13, 23. And thus again, when any other Strangers did voluntarily joyn themſelves to the Lord to be his Servants in a way of Proſelytiſm; the Lord by virtue of the Fathers doing ſo, laid claim to their Children, and required them to be brought into Covenant with him by their Males being Circumciſed.</p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:40113:65"/>
               <p>And thus we ſee why the whole body of the Jewiſh Nation might be all called Gods holy People, and yet not upon account of inherent ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>By the way then, all theſe things conſidered, we may obſerve one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why (as we may well conceive) the Apoſtles in their times Baptized the Houſholds of Chriſtian Parents when they Baptized the Parents them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For the Children of Chriſtian Parents became holy unto God with a <hi>Relative</hi> holineſs, by their Parents being his by Covenant, as well as the Children by Jewiſh and Proſelyted Parents had been in times before, as I ſhewed before from thoſe words, <hi>Elſe were your Children unclean, but now are they holy,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.14. And they being ſo, I cannot apprehend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſon why they ſhould not be as capable of being brought into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God by Baptiſm, as ever the Children of Jews, Proſelytes, and of the Bond-men of the Jews, had been by Circumciſion. And until
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40113:65"/>there can be a good reaſon aſſigned for the contrary, it is but reaſonable to believe that the Apoſtles in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing Houſholds, did Baptize little Children. For ſuch Children being born of Parents in Covenant with God, were qualified for being entred into Covenant themſelves: becauſe they were thereby called by God to profeſs the true Religion, ſuppoſing they ſhould live to be inſtructed by their Parents; who always teach their Children to be of the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which they profeſs themſelves. And this was under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and has been under the New, Gods ordinary way of calling men to profeſs the true Religion, as I have formerly ſhew'd.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another reaſon why the whole body of the Jews were called <hi>Gods Children, his Saints, or holy People,</hi> might be, becauſe they were ſuch by Covenant, in an external conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that is, they had Covenanted with God to be ſuch; and by that they were alſo ſeparated from other
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40113:66"/>People that were not called by his Name.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe of a partial performance of Covenant on their part. For they worſhipped the true God, and him only as yet (except in the caſe of the golden Calf) who therefore was called the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the world beſides worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Idols. They alſo worſhipped him with a worſhip of his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; the matter of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip conſiſted of Gods own inſtituted Ordinances, when the worſhip of all the reſt of the world, in a manner, conſiſted of Superſtitious and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous inventions. And by theſe they were a People ſeparated to God, and differenced from the reſt of the world: and thus far they glorified the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when the reſt of the world generally diſhonoured him by falſe worſhip, both in the object and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it.</p>
               <p>That which they were chiefly wanting in, was <hi>Morality,</hi> a true love to God, confidence in him, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40113:66"/>to him; and in juſtice and charity towards men, and humility, temperance, and ſobriety in reſpect of themſelves.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding which, God did not put this People of his out of his ſpecial protection, by delivering them into the hands of Spoilers, as in the days of the Judges, until they ſo groſly broke Covenant with him, as to <hi>ſerve other Gods.</hi> And when the Lord did at laſt put them away from him, as it were, and caſt them out of his ſight by ſending them into Captivity, the ten Tribes into <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and the two into <hi>Babylon,</hi> yet this did not befall them, until they had forſaken the Covenant they had made with God, and that in the higheſt, in <hi>worſhipping other Gods, and in obſerving the Statutes of the Heathen.</hi> Tho their immoralities were otherwiſe very great, yet God did not give this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a <hi>Bill of Divorce,</hi> until they had horribly corrupted themſelves with ſpiritual Whoredome in point of worſhip. See how their being caſt
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40113:67"/>off by God is charged in ſpecial upon this kind of breach of Covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.25. &amp; 31, 20. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.15, 16, 35, 38. <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.9. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.59. and other places. All which does intimate that Almighty God owned them for his People externally, ſo long as they owned him only for their God, according to their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him, tho otherwiſe they had great guilt upon them.</p>
               <p>This ſtill confirms what was ſaid before; that tho the immoralities of this People, for the generality of them, were ſuch in other reſpects, as that all that they had done in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting, and in a partial performance of Covenant, could not give them the reputation of being Members of the <hi>Inviſible Church,</hi> yet their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, and partial perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances of it, in worſhipping him only with a worſhip of his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, did denominate them in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and viſible reſpect to be his People, and ſo his, as the reſt of the world were not.</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:40113:67"/>
               <p>By the way then, if thoſe of this Church under the Old Teſtament were ſtiled Saints, a holy People, and the like, upon other accounts, and in other reſpects than their being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and <hi>inherently holy,</hi> as I have ſhewed they were, by inſpired men, then it cannot be concluded but that the People of the Churches in the New Teſtament were ſo likewiſe, when the Apoſtles in their Epiſtles to them, ſtiled them <hi>Saints, the Sanctified in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and the like. For the ſame Epithetes and Appellations ſignifie but the ſame thing in the Old Teſtament as in the New. In both they ſignifie a People ſeparated from the Pagan unbelieving world, unto God, among whom ſome were more ſo, and ſome leſs, ſome by <hi>external</hi> Covenant and profeſſion, and ſome by that and much more, to wit, by <hi>the Renovation of the whole inner man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I the rather note this as I paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, becauſe thoſe of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational way, lay ſo great a ſtreſs as
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40113:68"/>they do upon St. <hi>Pauls</hi> ſtiling the Churches to whom he wrote, <hi>Saints,</hi> for the proving as they would have it, that none but ſuch as are ſavingly ſanctified are Church-matter, or to be admitted as Church-Members, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept when it is done through miſtake of them that admit them.</p>
               <p>Having taken a brief ſurvey how things ſtand related, touching Viſible Church-Memberſhip under the Old Teſtament; I ſhall now proceed to enquire how matters ſtand declared touching the ſame under the New. And our inquiry muſt be whether perſons adult, are by no other means Viſible Church-Members, unleſs they are <hi>reputatively</hi> Members of the Church as <hi>Inviſible.</hi> Or whether they do not become truly Members of the Viſible Church in Scripture ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count by their voluntary Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by Baptiſm with God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, tho it ſhould be ſuppoſed that there is not enough in them to denominate them Members of the Church as <hi>Inviſible.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:40113:68"/>
               <p>The queſtion is not whether it does not become thoſe who admit men into the Church by Baptiſm and the Baptiſmal Covenant, to think the beſt of them who are ſo admitted, and to hope they do it with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere mind, when they therein give up themſelves to God. But whether their due admiſſion thereto does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon ſuch a judgment in thoſe that admit them? Or whether ſuch Perſons may be refuſed, and not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to Covenant with God in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and thereby to enter into the Church, tho they offer themſelves thereto and deſire it, in caſe thoſe whoſe office and place it is to admit men thereto, ſhould be unſatisfied touching the truth of their ſaving Converſion or Regeneration?</p>
               <p>Or thus, the queſtion is not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not the duty of every man that enters into Covenant with God in Baptiſm, to do it with a ſincere mind, and with all his heart: But whether this be required by way of <hi>condition,</hi> without which it is neither
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40113:69"/>lawful for the perſon himſelf to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, nor for others to ſuffer him to do it, if they ſuſpect he will do it with ſuch a frame of mind, as is ſhort of Regeneration.</p>
               <p>Nor is the queſtion whether a man might not be refuſed admiſſion into the Church, in caſe there were cauſe to ſuſpect him to have an evil deſign in deſiring it, to betray the Chriſtians to their Enemies; upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of which ſuſpicion its proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Diſciples refuſed <hi>Saul</hi>'s joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them after his Converſion, tho he deſired it, until they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived better ſatisfaction concerning him. But the queſtion is whether ſuch as have only ſome general and in diſtinct belief that Chriſt is the Son of God, and Saviour of the world by his death; and that the way of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity is the way of Salvation, and do deſire admiſſion into the Chriſtian Church to be further inſtructed in that way; and in order thereto are willing to enter into Covenant with God, and to be Baptized: I ſay the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40113:69"/>queſtion is, whether ſuch may be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Covenant with God, and enter into the Church by Baptiſm, ſuppoſing them as yet to have no thorow ſaving work of Converſion wrought in them, but only ſo much as may be hoped is preparatory and diſpoſitory thereto, but yet have ſomething, tho not all, which is neceſſary to it, and whoſe profeſſion is ſerious and ſincere ſo far as it goes, as that is oppoſed to diſſembling knowingly.</p>
               <p>And to prove that they may, and that the lawfulneſs of ſuch Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by Baptiſm, does not depend upon their being ſavingly Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate: and that our Saviour himſelf owns Unregenerate men received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Viſible Church by ſuch Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting in Baptiſm, to be as well Members of it, as the Regenerate, I ſhall offer ſeveral things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And I ſhall lay down this firſt as a foundation to build upon in this proof, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is not a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful in it ſelf, for ſome ſuch as are not of the Church as Inviſible by rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40113:70"/>Grace, to enter into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God to be his People; nor is ſuch a qualification enjoyned as a neceſſary condition of doing ſo.</p>
               <p>When all the Males at Age in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> Houſe were commanded to enter into Covenant with God by Circumciſion: And when his Seed after him were required to cauſe all the Male-ſtrangers bought with their money to do the like: And when the Proſelytes from among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles were required to Circumciſe themſelves and all their Males, and thereby to enter into Covenant with God: I ſay in all this there was no ſuch thing as their being Circumciſed in heart, enjoyned as a condition of their ſo entring into Covenant by Circumciſion. The Lord alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Joſhua</hi> to Circumciſe all the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Males that in the ſpace of forty years had been born in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which was an entering them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Covenant with God, and this without any condition of ſuch quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication as would have made them of the Church as Inviſible.</p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:40113:70"/>
               <p>Nay, Almighty God at another time commanded all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Children, and the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in their Camp, to enter into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him, and into his Oath, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11, 12. This command was abſolute and peremptory alſo, and without condition. The Lord did not in this, nor in any of the other inſtances require men to enter into Covenant with him only upon this condition, that they did already tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fear him, and ſincerely love him, or otherwiſe to forbear: No, but he required this Covenanting with him, to this end, that they might truly fear and love him, and cleave to him only; as a means to ſuch an end.</p>
               <p>No man will ſay that Almighty God did fore-know when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all thoſe fore-mentioned to enter into Covenant with him, that in doing it, they would all of them be qualified with ſuch regenerating Grace, and ſpiritual Life, as all thoſe are, who are of the Church as Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; which yet they muſt ſay or
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40113:71"/>ſuppoſe, if they will ſay, that the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Covenanting with God does depend upon their being Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate when they do it; unleſs they will ſay, that God commanded ſuch of them as were not ſo qualified, to do a thing which in its own nature was ſinful and unlawful, which I preſume none will dare to ſay.</p>
               <p>By all which, it appears with full evidence, as I apprehend, that it is not unlawful for ſome ſuch as are not of the Church as inviſible, to enter into Covenant with God to be his People: And that the lawfulneſs of ſuch Covenanting does not depend upon mens being qualified with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating Grace. And if ſo, then the lawfulneſs of mens being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Viſible Church by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting with God by Baptiſm, does not depend upon their being reputed Members of the Church as Inviſible, or ſuch as are Regenerate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. My next reaſon or argument I draw from our Saviours Commiſſion to his Apoſtles, directing them, who
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40113:71"/>or what manner of Perſons they ſhould Baptize, and by Baptiſm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive into his Viſible Church, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as were made Diſciples. The words of the Commiſſion run thus, <hi>Go ye therefore teach all Nations, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them,</hi> &amp;c. Or <hi>Diſciple</hi> all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or make Diſciples in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſo others render it. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles then according to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, were to Baptize all thoſe who firſt were made Diſciples, and by the Baptiſmal Covenant to enter them into the Church.</p>
               <p>Mens being <hi>made Diſciples</hi> then was the <hi>rule</hi> given by our Saviour, by which the Apoſtles were to govern themſelves, touching <hi>who</hi> and what manner of Perſons they were to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> into the Church <hi>by Baptiſm.</hi> And thoſe were Diſciples, who did attend upon the teaching of Chriſtian Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers with a deſire to learn their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, whether they had attained to Regeneration thereby or no. And ſuch the Apoſtles had in Commiſſion to Baptize. From this Commiſſion of Chriſt then I argue thus.</p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:40113:72"/>
               <p>If our Lord Jeſus commanded his Apoſtles to Baptize all that were Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and thereby to bring them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church (as he did) then he commanded or authoriſed more to be brought into the Viſible Church by the Baptiſmal Covenant, than were truly Regenerate. For men might be Diſciples in an inferior ſence, and were ſo, who yet were not Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. Such Diſciples had our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our himſelf. Such were thoſe, who upon the <hi>ſight of his Miracles believed on him,</hi> with whom yet he would <hi>not truſt himſelf, becauſe he knew what was in them.</hi> John 2.23, 24. And ſuch were thoſe, <hi>John</hi> 6.66. of whom it is ſaid, <hi>From that time many of his Diſciples went back, and walked no more with him.</hi> And ſuch an Unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Diſciple was <hi>Judas.</hi> And ſuch perhaps were <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> and ſuch was <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other unprofitable branches, that by Baptiſm had been planted into Chriſt the true Vine.</p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:40113:72"/>
               <p>And that our Saviour by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionating the Apoſtles to Baptize Diſciples, intended no leſs but that they ſhould Baptize all ſuch as were made or became Diſciples as ſuch, whether Regenerate or not; and that they could underſtand his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion no otherwiſe, our Saviours own practice and example will infer it. For tho he knew all men, and what was in them, and had declared in their hearing, that ſome of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples did not righty believe (<hi>John</hi> 6.64.) yet did not reject thoſe as no Diſciples, whom he knew to be Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate, ſo long as they followed him as Diſciples, but cauſed them to be Baptized as well as thoſe he knew to be better, as thoſe words imply, <hi>John</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>When therefore the Lord knew how the Phariſees had heard that Jeſus made and Baptized more Diſciples than</hi> John; <hi>tho Jeſus himſelf Baptized not, but his Diſciples,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe words imply both, that he cauſed as many to be Baptized as were made Diſciples, and that there were great
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40113:73"/>numbers famed to be ſo made and Baptized. And yet ſo far, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears there were but few of them that firmly cleaved to our Saviour till the laſt: For we read of but about an hundred and twenty Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that appeared as his avowed Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples after our Saviours Reſurrection, till the day of Pentecoſt. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>From all which, we may obſerve theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it was not diſagreeable to our Saviours mind, that more ſhould enter into Covenant with God by Baptiſm, and thereby be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Viſible Church, than were tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Regenerate: which is a further confirmation of our former argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That if the Apoſtles had known (as our Saviour did) thoſe Diſciples that offered themſelves to Baptiſm, being Unregenerate, to be ſo; yet that would not have made it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to admit them to Baptiſm, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, no more than what our Saviour cauſed to be done in like caſe, did.</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:40113:73"/>
               <p>All this ſhews, that men were received by the Apoſtles into the Church, upon other terms than the reputation of their being of the Church as Inviſible, before they were ſo received.</p>
               <p n="3">3. My next Argument to prove that they were, and that our Saviour would have his Apoſtles to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that they were to be received upon larger terms, I gather from our Saviours inſtructing his Apoſtles ſo thorowly, and ſo frequently as he did, that his Church would conſiſt of bad as well as good: which is alſo an argument that he did account ſuch to be a part and Members of his Viſible Church. Which we cannot think he would have done without cautioning them to look to it, and to take heed of letting ſuch into his Church; much leſs would he, on the contrary, have bid them compel men to come in, that his Houſe might be full, if he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned that the Apoſtles ſhould keep all out of the Church, but ſuch of whoſe effectual converſion to God they were well ſatisfied.</p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:40113:74"/>
               <p>Our Saviour by many Parables did thorowly inform his Apoſtles, that his Church would conſiſt of a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of bad as well as good, of fooliſh as well as wiſe. Thus he told them, that the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven ſhould be likened unto ten Virgins, whereof five Wiſe and five Fooliſh,</hi> Mat. 25.1, 2. By the Kingdom of Heaven our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in his Parables, and ſo in this, means the Kingdom of the Meſſias here on Earth, which is his Viſible Church, in which he Reigns and Rules by his Goſpel, as the Law of that Kingdom. And thoſe are the People or Subjects of this Kingdom, who own him for their King, and his Goſpel for the Law of his Kingdom. And the different effects which this Goſpel was to have in the lives and behaviour of ſuch as ſhould receive it, was accordingly foretold by our Saviour, and reſembled by various Parables, as it is here by the Wiſe and Fooliſh Virgins.</p>
               <p>Thus we have it again in another Parable concerning the Marriage of a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40113:74"/>Kings Son, to which both good &amp; bad were invited, and did come, and the Wedding was furniſhed with ſuch gueſts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>The Parable of the Wheat and the Tares that ſprang up amongſt it: The Parable of the Draw-net, that being caſt into the Sea, gathered of every kind, bad as well as good, are of the ſame import. And ſo is the Parable of the Sower and his Seed: Wherein four ſorts of Hearers or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Goſpel are reſembled by four ſorts of ground, into which the Seed fell, of which there is but one thorowly good, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>Add unto this, that our Saviour did not only fore-tell his Apoſtles by theſe Parables, what different ſucceſs the Preaching of the Goſpel would meet with, even among thoſe that would receive it, and how his Church would be filled with many bad as well as good; but alſo told them plainly, without a Parable, <hi>That many would be called, and yet but ſew choſen,</hi> Mat. 20.16.</p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:40113:75"/>
               <p>Wherefore, and for what reaſon (may we conceive) did our Saviour thus inſtruct his Diſciples, touching what the ſtate and condition of his Church would be, which ſhould be gathered by the Preaching of the Goſpel? but that they might not be diſappointed in their expectations, nor be offended when afterwards they ſhould find it to conſiſt of ſuch a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; or ever expect (tho they ſhould obſerve his rules for the purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Church) to find it otherwiſe, until the end of the world, the time appointed for a total <hi>gathering out of his Kingdom, all things that offend, and them which do iniquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that the Apoſtles did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand otherwiſe by our Saviours Parables and Doctrine, but that the worſer as well as the better Chriſtians were of this Kingdom of Heaven, the Viſible Church, their Epiſtles to ſuch Churches, in which there was ſuch a mixture, ſhew; for they counted them, and treated them as Chriſtian Brethren; in ſo much as St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:40113:75"/>would not have ſuch as deſerved Church-cenſure, and in ſome ſort were under it, to be <hi>counted as Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but admoniſhed as Brethren,</hi> 2 Theſ. 3.14, 15.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles then being thus tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly inſtructed by our Saviour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, touching the conſtitution of his Church of bad as well as good; it is no ways likely that they would receive none into the Church, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of ſuch as were truly Regenerate.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There are ſome circumſtances relating to the Apoſtles receiving Perſons into the Viſible Church by Baptiſm, which render it incredible that they did not ſo receive any, but upon the reputation and eſteem they had of being of the Church as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible.</p>
               <p>Firſt, one thing was the <hi>doctrine</hi> by which they moſt prevailed with men to become Diſciples. Which doctrine was the Preaching that pardon of ſin, and the happineſs of Eternal Life are to be had by Chriſts ſuffering for Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40113:76"/>if they believe in him, and the Preaching to the People, that this Jeſus roſe from the Dead after his. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies had put him to death, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the truth of what they ſaid by aſtoniſhing miracles. It's true, they did together with this, Preach the neceſſity of <hi>Repentance alſo:</hi> But the glad tidings of Pardon and Salvation by a Saviour ſo extraordinarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed as it was, being <hi>new,</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of before, eſpecially among the Gentiles, and being ſo hugely comfortable as it was, did ſo ſtrongly affect the People, as made them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtontly turn Diſciples, and to promiſe, no doubt, a reformation of life, with an intent to perform, while they were thus filled with joy. But many of them after this tranſport of affection and newneſs of joy was over, tho they held faſt the comfortable part of their profeſſion of faith in Chriſt, and in his Death, yet proved partial and defective in reforming their lives, which rendred the work of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in them very doubtful at leaſt, or rather worſe than ſo.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:40113:76"/>
               <p>And the Apoſtles were fore-warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pre-inſtructed by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, that upon their Preaching the joyful news which the Goſpel brings, many would be ſo taken with it, as readily and joyfully to become Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and turn Chriſtian in profeſſion, who yet would afterwards, when times of tryal came, either Apoſtotize and fall off, or foully faulter in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that profeſſion, by carnal ſhifts to ſecure themſelves from Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution. For our Saviour had told them this, by opening to them who or what manner of hearers he meant by thoſe reſembled in the Parable to the ſtony ground on which the Seed fell; and ſaid they were ſuch, as when they heard the word, would <hi>immediately receive it with gladneſs,</hi> but afterwards in time of temptation, would be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, as not having root in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>Mar.</hi> 4.16.</p>
               <p>All which conſidered, it was no ways probable that the Apoſtles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all they Baptized under the notion of Perſons already truly Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40113:77"/>but as Diſciples only, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the tenour of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, another circumſtance is the <hi>great haſt</hi> the Apoſtles made to Baptize Perſons when once they had prevailed with them to conſent to it. <hi>The ſame day</hi> of Pentecoſt they Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thoſe mentioned, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. they Baptized about three thouſand of them. And ſo <hi>Philip</hi> Baptized the Eunuch <hi>preſently</hi> upon the Road, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>once</hi> Preaching to him. And the Jaylor and all his were Baptized <hi>ſtraight-way,</hi> and <hi>in the ſame hour of the night</hi> in which <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> firſt Preached to them, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.33. I think there can no inſtance be given of their delaying ſo much as four and twenty hours to Baptize any after they were willing to be Baptized.</p>
               <p>This is another thing which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it very incredible, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Baptized none but upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their being eſteemed Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, or that they did Baptize Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ordinarily by any other rule than
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40113:77"/>that contained in the letter of their Commiſſion, which was to Baptize thoſe that were Diſciples, as ſuch. If they had thought it neceſſary to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize none but whom they could pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently eſteem to be of the Inviſible Church, they would in all likelihood have ſuſpended the Baptizing of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at leaſt, until they had had ſome tryal of the conſtancy of their reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and experience of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. And ſo much the rather, becauſe it is hard to make any good judgment of mens ſincerity by what they do on a ſudden under ſome tranſport of affection, and before they have had ſome time in cooler thoughts to deliberate upon what they engage to do.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, their <hi>refuſing none</hi> that were willing to be Baptized, argues that they did not think none were to be Baptized before they were Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, or did ſeem to be ſo. They refuſed none (ſo far as appears) that were willing to be Baptized, and to come into the Church, how notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40113:78"/>bad ſoever they had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> is a famous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this nature. And ſome were admitted into the Church by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, before they had quite loſt off their Idolatrous worſhip. For <hi>ſome with conſcience of the Idol unto this hour, eat it as a thing offered to an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol,</hi> and their conſcience being weak, is defiled, ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> concerning ſome in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> whom he afterwards admoniſheth to flee from Idolatry, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.7. &amp; 10.14.</p>
               <p>Now if a judgment of mens being truly Regenerate had been the rule by which the Apoſtles and others had governed themſelves in Baptizing of men, ſuſpicion would hardly have ſuffered <hi>Philip</hi> to have Baptized ſuch an one as <hi>Simon</hi> the Sorcerer without ſome conſiderable tryal of him. And conſidering what diſcerning men the Apoſtles were, it is very ſtrange that they ſhould diſcern none of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to be Baptized whom yet they did Baptize, that were very bad before they were Baptized, and proved to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40113:78"/>be ſo ſtill ſhortly after: I ſay this would ſeem ſtrange, in caſe nothing leſs had qualified them for Baptiſm, than a reputation of their being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate.</p>
               <p>Theſe circumſtances conſidered, together with the plain rule the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had in their Commiſſion, whom to Baptize, to wit, Diſciples as ſuch; it is more than probable that they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned themſelves by that rule, and Baptized thoſe they did Baptize un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of Diſciples, or ſuch as were learning to be Chriſtians, without tying themſelves to a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they were already Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Our bleſſed Saviour who does not judge according to outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, but according to his cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge of things, does ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſuch to be of his Viſible Church, whom yet he knows to be none of the Inviſible. This I gather from his own words, <hi>John</hi> 15.2. <hi>Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away.</hi> By which, he ſuppoſeth, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40113:79"/>plainly intimates, that there would be many ſuch branches <hi>in him,</hi> by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Viſible Church, which yet being unfruitful, and to be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, are therefore not of the Inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For by their being <hi>in him,</hi> is doubtleſs meant of their being exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally and viſibly <hi>united to him</hi> as members of his body, the Church as Viſible. And how can we conceive them to be united to him ſo as to be ſaid to be <hi>in him,</hi> but by Covenanting with him in Baptiſm? For by that they are brought into him: <hi>Baptized into Chriſt,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. and <hi>planted in him by Baptiſm,</hi> Rom. 6.5.</p>
               <p>And upon the ſame account, and for the ſame reaſon for which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour judgeth and accounteth men to be in him, to be of his Viſible Church, we may, we muſt ſo account them likewiſe. The Scripture knoweth no other being in Chriſt, but by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing united and related to him, either by external Covenanting with him, or by internal Renovation. In this
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40113:79"/>latter ſence, ſuch unfruitful branches as our Saviour ſpeaks of in the Text aforeſaid, are not in him: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be underſtood in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſence, unleſs any third ſence of mens being in Chriſt can be found out in Scripture, which I never yet heard of.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Our bleſſed Saviour in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times owned ſuch to be of his Viſible Church as were not of the Inviſible, by pouring out upon them miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghoſt. That there were ſuch gifts poured out upon ſuch men as tho they did believe, yet not to the ſaving of the ſoul, is evident by our Saviours own words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Many will ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not Propheſied in thy name, and in thy name have caſt out Devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profeſs unto them, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew you. Depart from me ye that work iniquity.</hi> And the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> plainly ſuppoſes that ſuch as were <hi>partakers of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:40113:80"/>might be ſo bad as quite to fall away from the Chriſtian profeſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>And that our Saviour by pouring out ſuch gifts upon ſuch men, did own them as related to him, and as Members of his Viſible Church, will appear when we conſider that the promiſe of theſe was made to ſuch as ſhould believe and only to ſuch, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.17. <hi>Theſe ſigns ſhall follow thoſe that believe: In my name ſhall they caſt out Devils, they ſhall ſpeak with new</hi> tongues. By conferring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch Believers, whoſe faith did not operate to Regeneration, he ſet his Seal upon them as mark'd for his in a viſible relation. For the pouring out of miraculous gifts of the Spirit, is called the ſealing of the Spirit. <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ye believed, ye were ſealed with the holy ſpirit of promiſe,</hi> Ephe. 1.13.</p>
               <p>There was a two-fold ſeal of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; the one by inward ſanctification, or renewing men to the Image of God. Of this St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to ſpeak, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Who hath ſealed us, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40113:80"/>given the earneſt of the ſpirit in our hearts.</hi> This Sealing belongs to the Inviſible ſtate of the Church. But then there was a ſealing of the ſpirit which belonged then to the viſible ſtate of the Church, by which, a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible mark or ſeal was ſet upon them, and by which God owned them as related to him as Members of his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, and that was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring upon them ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary or miraculous gifts. And this was common to thoſe that had but common grace, and were unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, as well as to them that had ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, as appears by the 7th. of <hi>Mat.</hi> and 6th. of <hi>Heb.</hi> fore-mentioned. Theſe extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghoſt ſeem to be confined to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>God hath ſet in the Church, Apoſtles, Prophets and Teachers, then Miracles, gifts of Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, diverſities of Tongues;</hi> by which, thoſe that had them beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, were known to be of the Church, and to be owned by God to be ſo.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:40113:81"/>
               <p>The conferring miraculous gifts upon ſuch men as yet ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by Chriſt at laſt, as workers of iniquity, argues theſe things. Firſt, that they were Believers in Chriſt in a ſence, becauſe they wrought their Miracles in his Name, and by virtue of Faith in his Name: And becauſe our Saviour had ſaid that ſuch ſigns as they ſhew'd ſhould <hi>follow them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> Mark 16.17. Secondly, that they profeſſed the Chriſtian doctrine: for that miraculous power was conferred upon them for the confirmation of the doctrine they profeſſed and Preached. <hi>The Lord working with them, and confirming the Word with ſigns following,</hi> verſ. 20. Beſides, our Saviour brings them in pleading that they had Propheſied in his Name. Thirdly, they being Believers, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors and Preachers of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an doctrine, it argues that they had been Baptized, and by Baptiſm made Members of the Viſible Church, and that our Saviour did own them for ſuch, by conferring on them ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40113:81"/>gifts which he did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon Unbelievers.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I might add in the laſt place, that our Saviour owns ſome bad men to be related to him as <hi>his Servants.</hi> Hence it is that he calls them <hi>Servants,</hi> tho <hi>ſlothful Servants,</hi> Mat. 25, 26. <hi>unprofitable Servants,</hi> verſ. 30. <hi>evil Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> Mat. 24.48. <hi>wicked Servants,</hi> chap. 18.32. The title of Servants is given to ſuch as theſe, becauſe they are of the Houſhold of the great Lord and Maſter; that is, Members of his Viſible Church, which is his Houſe. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>in a great Houſe</hi> (and ſo in the Church he means) <hi>there are not only Veſſels of gold, and of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but alſo of wood and of earth, and ſome to honour, and ſome to diſhonour,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.20. And our Saviour hath ſaid, <hi>that many ſhall come from the Eaſt and Weſt, and ſhall ſit down with</hi> Abraham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>in the Kingdom of Heaven; but the Children of the Kingdom ſhall be caſt out into outer darkneſs,</hi> Mat. 8.11, 12.</p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:40113:82"/>
               <p>Having ſeen what evidence the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures do afford to prove that God, that Chriſt himſelf does own others to be part of his Viſible Church, than ſuch as are of the Church as inviſible, I ſhall now proceed to take into conſideration ſuch Texts of Scripture as in the apprehenſion of ſome ſeem moſt to favour the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry opinion.</p>
               <p>I will begin with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. <hi>The like figure whereunto Baptiſm doth alſo now ſave us, not the putting away the filth of the fleſh, but the anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God, by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Whence it is argued, that thoſe who were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Church by Baptiſm, were always ſuppoſed ſuch as had the anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God, the inward qualification which anſwers the outward figure or ſign in Baptiſm, Death unto ſin, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection unto a new life.</p>
               <p>But the anſwer to this is very eaſie. The Apoſtle in theſe words was ſhewing what is neceſſary in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40113:82"/>Baptized, beſides their Baptiſm, to make their Baptiſm available to their ſalvation; but not what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary by way of condition to their being Baptized: this Text meddles not with that, ſo far as appears by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny clauſe or circumſtance in it. And is much of the ſame nature, and much like to that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 2.28, 29. where he ſaith, <hi>That is not Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion which is outward in the fleſh, but that which is of the heart and in the ſpirit.</hi> By which, he does not mean that Circumciſion which was but out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the fleſh, ſerved to no other ends, but to ſignifie Heart-circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for it did engage the Circumciſed in Covenant with God, and initiate them, and give them entrance into the Church, and made them parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Oracles and Ordinances of God there, as he ſhews in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words in the next Chapter: But his meaning was, that Circumciſion in the fleſh alone, without Circumciſion of the heart, would not avail to any mans having acceptance with God.</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:40113:83"/>
               <p>So here, that Baptiſm which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in outward waſhing only, the putting away the filth of the fleſh, will not ſave, will not avail to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without the anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God. But then it does not follow, but that it may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail as well as Circumciſion in the Letter did, to bring men into the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, and to procure them the benefit of the outward privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of it.</p>
               <p>Another Text is, <hi>John</hi> 3.5. <hi>Except a man be born of Water, and of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> Some that are of the opinion which I am oppoſing, by the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God here, underſtand the Church, as well Viſible as Inviſible, and then infer, that none can enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church without being born of the Spirit as well as of Water.</p>
               <p>But the anſwer to this is very eaſie. For if by Kingdom of God here, we underſtand either the Church as Inviſible, or the Kingdom of glory, it is granted that men cannot enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40113:83"/>to the Kingdom of God except they be born of the Spirit. But then this does not at all oppoſe what I have been proving, <hi>viz.</hi> That Men may be, and many really are Members of the Viſible Church, and that in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, who yet are none of the Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church by being born of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or internally Regenerated.</p>
               <p>And that by Kingdom of God here, cannot be meant the Viſible Church, is evident, becauſe many have entered into it, who yet have not been born of the Spirit, as I have, as I think, abundantly proved, againſt all reaſonable contradictions. Our Saviour we ſee ſpeaks here of a being <hi>born of Water,</hi> and of a being <hi>born of the Spirit,</hi> which are two diſtinct things. And there are many that have been born of Water, and thereby entered into the Viſible Church, that have never been born of the Spirit. And there are many alſo that have entered into the Viſible Church by being born of Water, who have been born of the Spirit, but not till afterwards,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40113:84"/>not till ſome time after they have been in the Viſible Church. We muſt ſuppoſe this, or elſe ſay there is no poſſibility of effectual converſion in the Viſible Church; which is a thing ſo abſurd to imagine, and ſo much againſt all experience, as that no man, I think, has the heart to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert it, which yet muſt be aſſerted if the other be denied.</p>
               <p>It is further alledged from thoſe words, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. <hi>According to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy he ſaved us by the waſhing of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> I ſay it is hence alledged, that ſince Baptiſm is called the waſhing of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, that therefore thoſe who are admitted to Baptiſm, muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be Regenerated before or in Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Anſwer. This follows not, ſince Baptiſm may be called the waſhing of Regeneration for another reaſon, and in another reſpect more probable, and that is, becauſe men by Covenant are engaged to become new men, and to lead new lives. And it is from this
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40113:84"/>engagement by Baptiſm that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo often exhorts and perſuades Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to mortification and a new life, as we ſee he does, <hi>Rom</hi> 6.2, 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. &amp; 3.1, 2. <hi>As John</hi> the Baptiſt Baptized the People <hi>unto Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> Mat. 3.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>. So they are Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized <hi>unto</hi> Regeneration; that is, they are thereby brought under a ſolemn engagement to repent, and ſo to be Regenerate. And in this reſpect Baptiſm is properly enough called the Laver of Regeneration. Not that Baptiſm does inwardly Regenerate by the act done or ſuffered to be done, tho it does engage to it; but it is the work of the Holy Ghoſt as the principal agent, and therefore is here called the Renewing of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>And its evident that the waſhing of Regeneration, and the Renewing of the Holy Ghoſt are here mentioned as two different things, as they are in their own nature. Altho the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians here ſpoken of, were ſaid to be ſaved according to Gods mercy by
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40113:85"/>both, yet it no ways follows that this end could not be attained, unleſs they were renewed by the Holy Ghoſt at the ſame inſtant in which they were Baptized, for the one might ſucceed the other in point of time, as often it hath done. And if ſo, there can no neceſſity be inferred from hence of not admitting men to the one, but upon ſuppoſition of their being already qualified with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>It is true, men by Baptiſm it ſelf are brought into a new ſtate externally; they are brought into a new relation to God, to Chriſt, and to the Church his body, and to new enjoyments al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the Church. And it is to be noted our Saviour calls Baptiſm, a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born of <hi>Water,</hi> as a birth diſtinct from that of being born of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> Our Saviour in that diſcourſe of his with <hi>Nicodemus</hi> about Baptiſm, and being born again, ſeems to allude to the Jews cuſtom of receiving <hi>Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes</hi> by Baptiſm as well as by Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, who did reckon they were
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40113:85"/>thereby born again as it were, and brought into a new ſtate of life, as is well known by the tenour of the writings of the Jewiſh Doctors. And altho by being born of Water, men may be ſaid to be born of the Spirit in one ſence, for they are Baptized into the Name of the Holy Ghoſt, as well as into the Name of the Father and the Son: and <hi>by one ſpirit we are all Baptized into one body,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle faith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. Yet in a higher and more emphatical ſence, all that are born of the Spirit, are not ſo born when they are Baptized, but moſt of them afterwards, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the Church doth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly manifeſt.</p>
               <p>Again, another Scripture is <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. <hi>Repent and be Baptized every one of you, in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Now it may be ſome will argue hence, that ſince Baptiſm is enjoyned in order to the obtaining of remiſſion of ſins: and ſince Baptiſm alone without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance here required with it, will not
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40113:86"/>avail for the obtaining ſuch remiſſion, that therefore a being Baptized for the remiſſion of ſins, always ſuppoſes Repentance in him that is Baptized.</p>
               <p>Anſwer. The moſt that can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred hence, is, that Baptiſm as well as Repentance, and Repentance as well as Baptiſm are directed to, and enjoyned in order to the obtaining Remiſſion of ſins; but not that ſuch Repentance as is available to this end, is enjoyned as <hi>the condition</hi> of being Baptized, and by that to be received into the Church. Tho I deny not, but that in the adult a profeſſion of ſorrow for ſin paſt, and a promiſe of amendment for time to come, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways required before Baptiſm, but ſorrow for ſin alone, avails not to the obtaining of remiſſion of ſin, and what the promiſe of amendment for the future would prove, was uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to thoſe who received Perſons into the Church by Baptiſm. The Apoſtles, we may well ſuppoſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſuch raw Diſciples to Baptiſm, as thoſe were to whom this counſel
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40113:86"/>was here given, upon like terms that <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt received the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes that flock'd to him for Baptiſm; <hi>and they were Baptized, confeſſing their ſins:</hi> They confeſſed themſelves ſuch ſinners as needed amendment, and profeſſed ſorrow for what was paſt; and by receiving Baptiſm, engaged themſelves to amend for time to come, and accordingly he is ſaid to Baptize them <hi>unto Repentance,</hi> Mat. 3.11. But very many of them fell ſhort afterwards of performing their engagement, <hi>John</hi> 5.35. Baptiſm and Repentance as ſaving are not inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in point of time, in reference to the obtaining Remiſſion of ſin. If a man do effectually repent, tho it be not till long after he is Baptized, yet his Baptiſm and Repentance will be effectual for the obtaining Remiſſion of ſins. And if ſo, then ſuch Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as is ſaving, is not of neceſſity before Baptiſm, to the obtaining of Remiſſion of ſins.</p>
               <p>But the truth is, if we will infer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing from the Text under conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40113:87"/>in reference to our preſent enquiry, it may be that which is ſo far from proving mens Viſible Church-Memberſhip to depend upon the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility and reputation of their being of the Church as Inviſible, as that it will much rather prove the direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>viz.</hi> That the credibility of mens being of the Church as Inviſible, depends upon their being of the Church as Viſible. For it tends to prove that men living under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel (and others I meddle not with in this matter) cannot approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be Members of the Inviſible Church, until they are firſt made Members of the Viſible by Baptiſm. For we ſee men are as well to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized for the Remiſſion of ſin, as to repent to obtain it: As the promiſe of being ſaved is elſewhere made unto a being Baptized, as well as it is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving (<hi>He that believeth and is Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Mark 16.16.) And if ſo, then a man cannot be concluded to be in a pardoned ſtate, that through his own default is not Baptized, by
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40113:87"/>which he ſhould be made of the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church: and if he cannot be concluded to be in a pardoned ſtate without this, then he cannot be duly reputed to be in the Inviſible Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, becauſe there are none in that Church-ſtate but what are pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>If any ſhould alledge the words of St. <hi>Paul, If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new Creature,</hi> (2 Cor. 5.17.) and infer that none are by Baptiſm, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe in Chriſt, but what are new Creatures, the anſwer to them is this:</p>
               <p>If by any mans being in Chriſt, be underſtood of ſuch a being in him as is ſaving, then he is indeed a new Creature, and truly Regenerate. But then that is ſuch a being in Chriſt as is not viſible to men, and therefore does not belong to our preſent inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But if you read the words accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Margent, If any man be in Chriſt, <hi>let him be a new Creature,</hi> then this Text does not infer, that if men be in Chriſt they are new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40113:88"/>but that they ought to be ſo, according to their Covenant-ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when they were planted into him by Baptiſm, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe urged to prove that a true ſaving faith, ſuch as makes men Members of the Church as Inviſible, is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as neceſſary to qualifie them for Baptiſm and Viſible Church-Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. For when the Eunuch ſaid to <hi>Philip, Here is Water, what doth hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me to be Baptized? Philip</hi> ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>If thou believeſt with all thine heart, thou maieſt,</hi> And he anſwered and ſaid. <hi>I believe that Chriſt is the Son of God.</hi> Here <hi>Philip</hi> ſeems to make a believing with all the heart, to be the <hi>condition</hi> of admitting the Eunuch to Baptiſm; and what leſs can a believing with all the heart be, than a true ſaving faith?</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer thus: That the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, ſuch as <hi>Philip</hi> was, did indeed ſuppoſe and expect a faith in Chriſt, in all adult Perſons whom they Baptized into him, is not to be doubted. Nor is
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40113:88"/>is it to be doubted, but that they preſs'd and perſuaded them to be very hearty and ſerious in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking the Chriſtian profeſſion when they Baptized them into it; and ſo did <hi>Philip</hi> here. But yet we ſee that for all that, <hi>Philip</hi> Baptized this Eunuch upon his bare profeſſing that he believed Jeſus Chriſt to be the Son of God; tho he did not ſay that he believed with all his heart. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on like terms we may ſuppoſe he had Baptized <hi>Simon Magus</hi> a little before, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. concerning whom the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tells us, not only that he ſaid he believed, as it does here of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch, but that he did indeed believe. <hi>Then</hi> Simon <hi>himſelf alſo believed,</hi> ſaith the Text. And ſo did thoſe mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>John</hi> 2.23. and ſo did thoſe who were likened to the Stony ground; for they <hi>believed for a time,</hi> but after fell away, <hi>Luk.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.13. <hi>And many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the chief Rulers alſo believed on Chriſt,</hi> who yet would <hi>not confeſs him,</hi> John 12.42. So that when men are ſaid to believe in Chriſt, it does not
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40113:89"/>always and neceſſarily imply a ſaving faith, or a new birth, or an Inviſible Church-ſtate. Men might and did believe in Chriſt before they were Baptized, who yet we cannot ſay were Regenerate by their believing, or in the Inviſible Church-ſtate; as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> for inſtance: And yet ſuch believing, or profeſſing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, qualified them for Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>And when <hi>Philip</hi> here required of the Eunuch a believing with all his heart, in order to his being Baptized; we cannot reaſonably think that he meant more thereby (if he propoſed it as a <hi>condition</hi> of his being Baptized) then that he ſhould <hi>be ſerious and real</hi> in it, in oppoſition to <hi>diſſembling.</hi> For that was as much as we can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably think the Eunuch was then capable of knowing concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and therefore no more could be expected from him.</p>
               <p>But then ſuch a believing with all the heart, could be no argument from which it could be concluded that therefore either he, or any other in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40113:89"/>his or lower circumſtances that did ſo believe, were therefore ſavingly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate. For it may very rationally be preſumed that <hi>all</hi> generally, who in the firſt times of the Goſpel, made profeſſion of faith in Chriſt, in order to their being Baptized, tho many of them Unregenerate, yet did really believe in Chriſt more or leſs. For what reaſon is it imaginable that they ſhould diſſemble when they profeſs'd faith in Chriſt, as the Son of God, in order to their being Baptized and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Church, when yet as the times were then, they could have no worldly advantage in proſpect, as a motive for them to diſſemble, and to profeſs and ſay they did believe what they <hi>knew</hi> they did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve?</p>
               <p>And that ſuch a believing as is real, and not diſſembled, may be ſaid to be a believing <hi>with all the heart,</hi> tho it proceed not from, nor is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a principle of regeneration or ſincerity in a moral ſence, will be yet rendred the more credible, if we
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40113:90"/>conſider what the Scripture ſays in a caſe not much unlike this under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. It is ſaid of <hi>all Juda,</hi> and <hi>Berjamin,</hi> and of the Strangers out of <hi>Ephraim, Manaſſeth,</hi> and <hi>Simeon,</hi> that they <hi>entered into Covenant with an Oath, to ſeek the Lord God of their Fathers, with all their heart, and with all their ſoul,</hi> 2 Chron. 15.12. And it's ſaid again at the 15th. verſ. <hi>That all</hi> Juda <hi>rejoyced at the Oath; for they had ſworn with all their heart.</hi> Now this Covenant and Oath entred into, was to engage them to worſhip the true God only, in oppoſition to their worſhipping of ſtrange Gods, in which many of them had been tardy, till <hi>Aſa</hi> the King ſet upon this work of Reformation, as we may ſee, <hi>chap.</hi> 14.3.</p>
               <p>And when it's ſaid that <hi>all Juda</hi> did thus Covenant and Swear <hi>with all then heart</hi> to ſeek the Lord God of their Fathers, it can in reaſon import no more in recerence to many of them, than to ſignifie that they did not <hi>diſſemble</hi> in doing it, but that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40113:90"/>there was really the conſent of their minds concurring with their verbal engagement by Covenant and Oath. For no conſidering man will think that this Covenanting by <hi>all</hi> the men of <hi>Juda,</hi> without limitation or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, could proceed from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principle of Regenerate or Spiritual life in reference <hi>to all</hi> or them; and yet they are <hi>all</hi> ſaid to do it, and with all their heart. And if not, then the Covenanting with sll the heart of ſuch of them as had no principle of ſpiritual life, muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of their doing it really, and without diſſembling the matter.</p>
               <p>I alledge all this to ſhow, that men may do things with all their heart in Religion, when yet what they ſo do, does not proceed from any principle of Regeneration, or a divine life. And if they may, then we cannot conclude, that tho <hi>Philip</hi> ſhould be underſtood to require a believing with all the heart, as a conditional qualification for Baptiſm, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he required ſuch a faith, as by
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40113:91"/>which a man muſt neceſſarily be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate before he may duly deſire Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>And the truth is, it is not to be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined that ſuch raw Diſciples as were generally Baptized, and of ſuch ſhort ſtanding as to be Baptized the ſame day, and ſometimes near the ſame hour, in which they were firſt inſtructed in the Chriſtian doctrin, could be able to know before they were Baptized, that they did indeed ſavingly believe; and if not, it could not be reaſonable to require the knowledge of ſuch a thing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, as a condition of their deſiring or requiring Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Men may eaſily know their own minds, whether they do believe Jeſus Chriſt to be the Son of God or no, and ſo may be able to profeſs without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation, that they do believe that he is, when they do indeed believe ſo. But becauſe many that did in thoſe times, and do in theſe believe in Jeſus Chriſt as ſent of God, and as the Son of God, who yet were not
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40113:91"/>then, nor are now truly renew'd by it in heart and life, therefore no man can ordinarily ſatisfie himſelf touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſoundneſs and ſavingneſs of his faith, but by ſome competent time of trial and experience of the life and power of it, by its effects in purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heart and life, and overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world, and working by love. We underſtand by St. <hi>James</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Writers of the holy Scriptures, that there were many, who knowing that they did believe, yet unduly promiſed themſelves juſtification and ſalvation from ſuch their believing, when yet it was not accompanied with ſuch works of a good and holy life, as by which faith is made perfect. And many ſuch there are, as is juſtly to be feared, now in our days. Theſe men deceived themſelves, they <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their own hearts,</hi> as St. <hi>James</hi> expreſſeth it: but not in thinking they did believe, for they knew they did, but in perſuading themſelves that their faith was ſufficient to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when yet it was but a <hi>dead and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40113:92"/>barren ſaith,</hi> not producing the fruits of a truly Chriſtian temper and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>
               <p>Now it was upon the believing Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to be the Son of God, or the Meſſiah, or he by whom alone ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is to be had, and an undiſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled profeſſion of this belief, that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies men for Baptiſm, however it proved afterwards as to the efficacy of in operation. And this real un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſembled belief, was that, I doubt not which <hi>Philip</hi> required of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch, when he ſaid. <hi>If thou believeſt with all thine heart thou maiſt be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</hi> And the Eunuchs anſwer, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he was Baptized by <hi>Philip,</hi> does intimate ſo much, when he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, I believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God. And more than this I conceive, cannot be duly inferred from thoſe words of <hi>Philip</hi> to the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch, for the reaſons I have already given.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the principal Texts made uſe of to countenance the opinion which I have in this Inquiry oppoſed.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40113:92"/>There are objections or pleas drawn from ſome other, which are well an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by Mr. <hi>Thomas Lamb,</hi> as ſome of theſe I have inſiſted on alſo are, in his <hi>freſh ſuit againſt Independency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus upon our Inquiry we have found as I conceive, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are of the Viſible Church in Scripture account, and ſo in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, by whoſe inſpiration the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were written, than thoſe which are of the Church as Inviſible, or them that ſeem to be ſo. For Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, as has been ſhown, account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and owneth ſuch to be his People in diſtinction from the reſt of the world, that have entered into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him, tho otherwiſe they or many of them, are far from ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be of the Church as Inviſible. And if God eſteem of them as ſuch, then ſo muſt his Servants likewiſe: and if the Scripture account them ſuch, it will become us to do ſo too, who profeſs to make the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the rule of our judgment.</p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:40113:93"/>
               <p>After that, upon our Inquiry we have found things thus; Let not any man now ſay, that by this doctrine we confound the Kingdom of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil with the Kingdom of God. For this would but reflect after an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly manner upon the wiſdom of God for thus numbering bad men as well as good to be of his Viſible Church, as externally related to him, and as worſhippers of him. Secret Hypocrites belong to the Kingdom of the Devil, as well as thoſe that are more viſibly ſuch; and yet none de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but that many ſuch are in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, nor do they count this a confounding Gods Kingdom with the Devils.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt but that the Devil has his Viſible and Inviſible Kingdom as well as God has his. But thoſe Hypocrites, whether ſecret or more open, which are of the Viſible Church, tho they are in a ſence of the Kingdom of the Devil, yet muſt be reckoned to be not of his Viſible, but of his Inviſible Kingdom. So
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40113:93"/>that the Hypotheſis I ſeek to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh, does not at all tend to confound Gods viſible Kingdom, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils viſible Kingdom one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, much leſs their Inviſible King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
               <p>For thoſe are not in Scripture rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned to be of the Viſible Kingdom of the Devil, who profeſſedly worſhip the true God, and him only, and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt as his Son and only Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, tho otherwiſe bad: But ſuch as worſhip Idols, other gods, and other mediators, in doing of which, they do in effect worſhip the Devil, who is the founder of ſuch worſhip.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Kingdoms or Nations are in Scripture counted of the Devils King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or Dominion, in which his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Ordinances (Idol-worſhip, and the Rites of that worſhip) are eſtabliſhed by publick Authority, as the Religion of thoſe Nations. As on the contrary, thoſe Nations or Kingdoms are counted Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, in which the Word and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God are by publick Authority
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40113:94"/>owned and eſtabliſhed as the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe Nations. Thus when Idol worſhip was put down, and caſt out of the ſeveral Territories of the Roman Empire by the firſt Chriſtian Emperors, and the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on eſtabliſhed by publick Authority, as the Religion of thoſe Nations, then the Devil was ſaid to be <hi>caſt down,</hi> and <hi>the Kingdom of God, and the power of his Chriſt, to be come,</hi> Rev. 12.9, 10. And again, <hi>The Kingdoms of this world</hi> are ſaid to <hi>become the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the Lord and of his Chriſt:</hi> When idol-worſhip which is Devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh worſhip, is rejected by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of thoſe Kingdoms, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.15. Not that there ſhall be no Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites or Carnal Profeſſors of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity in theſe Kingdoms, when they are thus become the Kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Chriſt: But tho there be, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> as the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doctrine and worſhip is owned and eſtabliſhed by the Government or ruling power of thoſe Kingdoms; and ſo long as the generality of the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40113:94"/>Inhabitants are for the ſame doctrine and worſhip in oppoſition to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous and Antichriſtian doctrine and worſhip, they are accounted to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Gods Viſible Kingdom in the world, and not the Devils, however many of thoſe Inhabitants may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Inviſible Kingdom of the Devil. And thus thoſe are called the <hi>Children of Gods Kingdom</hi> by our Saviour, who yet at laſt ſhall be <hi>caſt out into outer darkneſs,</hi> Mat. 8.12. But of this more afterwards.</p>

               <head>QUERY IX. <hi>WHether God hath granted any right to Church-priviledges, to thoſe who are only of the Church as Viſible, but not as Inviſible?</hi>
               </head>
               <p>That ſuch have right to them <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men,</hi> unleſs they are juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of them by Church-cenſures, thoſe will grant who yet deny that

And if that be true, which we now ſuppoſe we found to be ſo in our former enquiry, <hi>viz.</hi> that God himſelf doth own very many ſuch to be of the Church as Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, which yet are not at all of it as Inviſible; then it will be but reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to conclude from thence, that he does allow them a ſhare in the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and temporary priviledges of that relation, except in thoſe caſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he himſelf hath made an exception: For otherwiſe God by conferring on them the priviledge of Relation to himſelf and his Church, has conferred upon them a right to the priviledges of that relation, ſo far as the relation it ſelf extends. For the relation and the priviledges of the relation go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, except in caſe of forfeiture by miſcarriage. The union of parts does of it ſelf infer right to communion with them in things common to the whole,</p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:40113:95"/>
               <p>The right of thoſe in the Viſible Church, to Viſible Church-privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, does ariſe I conceive from that Covenanting between God and them in Baptiſm, by which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged themſelves to be his People, as God on the other hand had engaged himſelf to be their God on that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>Now for ought that appears from the Scriptures to the contrary, ſo far as they perform Covenant with God, in being a People unto him, ſo far he owns them to be his People; and ſo far as he does ſo, he allows them the priviledge of his People, which is a ſhare in his houſhold fare, and in the proviſions for his Family, which are his Word and Ordinances. If they worſhip no other God, and <hi>hold the Head</hi> Chriſt Jeſus in point of doctrine and worſhip, and own his doctrine and precepts as the rule of faith and life, and worſhip God in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and have the form of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, tho otherwiſe deſtitute of the power of it; yet as they are thus far
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40113:96"/>a People unto God, ſo God ſo far owns them as a People unto him, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated unto him from the Idolatrous and Infidel world, and accordingly allows them an intereſt and ſhare in the external priviledges of his People, of which communion in his Word and Ordinances is the chief. Only where God himſelf hath put a <hi>bar</hi> to this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, there the Viſible Church ought to do ſo too, as in thoſe caſes wherein deprivation by Church-cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures is enjoyned. Right to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the Church, comes in by mens relation to it as parts or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it: and ſo long as the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on continues, ſo long a right to the external priviledges continues, except in the caſe before excepted. Thoſe that are related to the Church, both as Viſible and Inviſible, have a right from God to Church priviledges both external, internal, and eternal: but thoſe who are related to the Church only externally as it is Viſible, have right only to the external priviledges of it.</p>

Three times in the year were all their Males to appear before the Lord to keep three ſolemn Feaſts appointed: and yet I think no body will imagine them to be all without exception of the Church as Inviſible.</p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:40113:97"/>
               <p>And when any Strangers from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles had a mind to turn Proſelytes to the Jews Religion, all that was required of them, to make them capable of communion in the Paſſover, was but to Circumciſe all their Males, by which they entred into Covenant with God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48.</p>
               <p>And ſince it was thus in the old Teſtament Church, it is not to be imagined that the terms of external communion ſhould be more rigorous and ſevere in the new, ſince our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours <hi>yoke is caſie, and his burden light,</hi> in compariſon of that among the Jews, which was a yoke as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>which neither they nor their Fathers were able to bear.</hi> All the ſame adult Perſons which were received into the Church by Baptiſm, were admitted to communion of the Church in the Ordinances of worſhip. Thus it was in the firſt Chriſtian Church, which was a pattern to all that followed, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41, 42. When the three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand were added to the Church by
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40113:97"/>Baptiſm; <hi>They continued in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Doctrine, and in breaking of bread and prayer,</hi> Acts 2.42</p>
               <p>And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>By one ſpirit we are all baptized into one body whether Jews or Gentiles, bond or free, and have been all made to drink into one ſpirit.</hi> The ſame <hi>all</hi> we ſee were made to drink into one ſpirit, which were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into one body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. By drinking into one ſpirit, is meant Communion in the Lords Supper, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſenſe of all Interpreters that I have met with. Again, he had ſaid thus, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.17. <hi>We being many, are one bread and one body, for we are all partakers of one bread.</hi> Here again the ſame <hi>all</hi> that made one body, were partakers of one bread. So that the extent of the Communion of the parts, equallized the union of the whole.</p>
               <p>Nor indeed is there any one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in Scripture that I can find, of any one perſon that has been refuſed Communion with a Chriſtian Church when he has deſired it, who has been
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40113:98"/>before received into the Church by Baptiſm, except ſuch as have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Cenſure of the Church for ſome Capital Offence. And ſuch indeed are to be excluded (until brought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance) by the Eccleſiaſtical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment under which they live. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> has given direction in what manner of Caſes, and for what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Offences men are to be procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt by Church Cenſure grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or leſſer, after due admonition otherwiſe uſed. <hi>But now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have written unto you, not to keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, if any man that is called a brother be a Fornicator, or Covetous, or an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later, or a Railer, or a Drunkard, or an Extortioner, with ſuch an one, no not to eat,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.11. For theſe and ſuch like Crimes, a Church may, and ought in her governing capacity, to deny her Communion with perſons guilty of them, after due admonition. And accordingly our Church has ordered publick admonition frequently to be made in theſe words with many other. <hi>If any of you be a blaſphemer
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40113:98"/>of God, a hinderer or ſlanderer of his Word, an Adulterer, or be in malice, or envy, or in any other grievous crime; Repent you of your ſins, or elſe come not to that holy Table, leſt after the taking of that holy Sacrament, the Devil enter into you, as he did into</hi> Judas, <hi>and fill you full of all iniquities, and bring you to deſtruction both of body and ſoul.</hi> And further, <hi>If any that deſire to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate be an open and notorious evil Liver, or have done any wrong to his Neighbour, by word or deed, ſo that the Congregation be thereby offended; the Curate having knowledge thereof, ſhall call him and advertiſe him, that in any wiſe he preſume not to come to the Lords Table until he hath openly declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have truly repented and amended his former naughty life, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation may thereby be ſatisfied, which before were offended. The ſame order ſhall the Curate uſe with thoſe betwixt whom he perceiveth malice and hatred to reign, not ſuffering them to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Lords Table, until he know them to be reconciled.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:40113:99"/>
               <p>I know there are ſeveral things wont to be alledged againſt admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuch to the Lords Supper who have not ſaving Grace; as,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That ſuch will but increaſe their ſin, and further their Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by partaking of it, ſo long as they are unregenerate. To which it may be Anſwered, (1.) That ſuch would no leſs ſin by neglecting to Obey Chriſts Command, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> and in neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to prepare themſelves for it, than they do when they come to this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of our Lord unprepared, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed more. For by not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they make themſelves guilty of a double Diſobedience; the one in not doing what Chriſt has Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be done in remembrance of him; the other in not preparing to do it after a right manner, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by coming unprepared, they make themſelves guilty but of one of them. (2.) For the ſame reaſon Men ſhould not Pray while unregenerate, as not come to the Sacrament while they are
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40113:99"/>ſo. For they are required to do both the one and the other in a right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as well as to do them at all. But yet no judicious Man will ſay, that all unregenerate Men ought to reſtrain Prayer before God, or to be reſtrained from it. For it is poſſible, and to be hoped, that their Praying may have that good effect upon them as to make them better: And the ſame may be ſaid of ſuch mens com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Sacrament. (3.) Though the Scripture directs that by Church-Cenſure Men ſhould be debarr'd from the Sacrament for open Acts of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, yet I know not where it directs to keep them from it for want of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Grace, ſo long as not guilty of ſuch Scandal.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Obj.</hi> It is again Objected, that this Ordinance is appointed for the <hi>Confirmation</hi> of the Converted, but not for the <hi>Converſion</hi> of the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I grant indeed that this Sacrament is not appointed for mens firſt Converſion to Chriſtianity, or for
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:40113:100"/>unbaptized Perſons: But yet it may be very uſeful together with other means, to carry on the work of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion from common Grace to ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial: And yet ſuch is the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion generally which is wrought in ſuch as are Educated in the Chriſtian Religion. The uſe of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in conjunction with Chriſtian Doctrine, may very well contribute its ſhare in carrying on this progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive change in Men by improving common Grace into ſpecial. <hi>The Preaching of the Croſs is to us who are ſaved, the Power of God to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18. And Chriſt as Crucified, is by the Lords Supper Preached to the <hi>ſeeing</hi> of the Eye, as well as by Word and Doctrine he is Preached to the <hi>hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the Ear: And <hi>the Eye affecteth the Heart,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks, as well as the Ear: And therefore the one may help on the work of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion from common Grace to ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, as well as the other. And in all likelyhood it often does ſo, as we
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40113:100"/>have reaſon to think when we ſee Men who as may be ſeared have no more than common Grace, upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of their going to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to become more ſerious both before and after, than uſually they are at other times. And if ſuch would but frequent it often, it might well be hoped that it would work a great alteration in them, by making them often more ſerious and conſiderate about the things of their Souls. And indeed what is more likely to beget a love to our Bleſſed Saviour, than ſuch a lively repreſentation of his wonderful love in dying for us, as is made in the Celebration of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Obj.</hi> The giving this Sacrament to ſuch as by a ſaving Faith are not in Covenant with God, is but like ſetting a Seal unto a blank. To which it is anſwered,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That this Sacrament is not a Seal of Mans Faith, but of Gods Covenant; and the Seal that is ſet to that, is not ſet to a Blank. The Lords
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:40113:101"/>Supper is not a Seal to aſſure ſuch as receive it, that they have Faith, but to aſſure them of Gods Faithfulneſs in his Covenant, and to work in them a confidence in that. Circumciſion, which was a Seal of the Covenant, was not ſet to a blank when applyed to Children before they had Faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, though this Sacrament be indeed a Seal of Gods Covenant directly, yet it muſt be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the end and deſign of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, is to help Mens Faith in Gods Faithfulneſs and Goodneſs in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to what he has promiſed in his Covenant. But then though this be ſo, yet the giving this Sacrament to ſuch who have but common Faith, cannot be ſaid to be like ſetting a Seal to a blank; becauſe a common Faith, ſuch as unregenerate Men may have, is more than no Faith at all, and yet it is the having no Faith at all, which can only anſwer to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Seal to a blank in this caſe. For a common Faith may be improved until it become ſpecial, as I have
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:40113:101"/>ſhewed; and upon that account this Sacrament being a Sacrament for Mens improvement in Faith and Love, may as well belong to them who have but common Faith as to thoſe whoſe Faith is ſpecial and ſaving. And indeed what is more likely to make a Faith which is but dull and unactive, as a common Faith is, to become lively and vigorous, than that which with great Advantage is to this end, repreſented to the Mind in this Sacrament? as I ſaid before.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I might add, that the Covenant made in Baptiſm, is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized and renewed in the uſe of the Lords Supper; and this doubtleſs may be done by ſuch as have but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Faith, as well as by thoſe who have that which is ſpecial and ſaving.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Obj.</hi> The ſaying of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup,</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged againſt mens being admitted or preſuming to come to the Lords Supper who have not ſaving Grace,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:40113:102"/>though otherwiſe free from Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Offences. They ſuppoſe Saving Grace, Repentance, Faith, and Love, to be the Matter about which the Apoſtle would have Men to examine themſelves, as neceſſary to qualifie them for <hi>Lawful</hi> Communion in that Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Now that for Men to examine themſelves whether they have ſaving Grace or no, is very neceſſary for their Preparation for coming to the Sacrament, is granted; becauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they will the better come to know the ſtate of their own Souls, and what it is that hinders their <hi>aſſurance</hi> of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch Grace, and the neceſſity of removing it, and their need of ſuch a Saviour as he is whoſe Love they are to commemorate in that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And God forbid that I ſhould in the leaſt encourage any to neglect the beſt Preparation they can make for ſo concerning a buſineſs as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to the Table of the Lord is. And except by examination they can find in themſelves ſome knowledge
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:40113:102"/>and belief that Chriſt Jeſus is the Saviour of Sinners, by dying for them, and of the Nature and End of this Sacrament in general; I do not underſtand how they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any benefit by coming to it.</p>
               <p>But to conclude from this ſaying of the Apoſtle, that Men are to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear coming to the Table of the Lord, until by ſelf-examination they can ſatisfie themſelves that they have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Grace, I think to be more than ever the Apoſtle intended in thoſe words. For ſuch ſatisfaction and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance is hardly attainable while Chriſtians are but weak and unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced, though known to God to be ſincere. And for this cauſe it ſeems to be more than is fit to be impoſed upon Men as a <hi>condition</hi> of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>But by the reaſon which St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives in verſe 29. why he would have Men to examine themſelves before they eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup, it appears that the thing in ſpecial and in particular concerning
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40113:103"/>which he would have them examine themſelves, was about their Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of <hi>diſcerning the Lords Body</hi> in doing it. For he tells them that if they did not diſcern the Lords Body in eating that Bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they would eat and drink <hi>unworthily,</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Judgment</hi> to themſelves.</p>
               <p>For our better underſtanding the ſcope and meaning of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in this his Diſcourſe touching unworthy Communicating at the Lords Table, we will enquire alittle, what he means by eating and drinking <hi>unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily;</hi> what by not <hi>diſcerning the Lords Body;</hi> and what by being <hi>guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>unworthy</hi> eating of that Bread, and drinking that Cup of the Lord, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, ſignifies the receiving thoſe Sacred Symbols of Chriſts Body and Blood, with a frame of Mind incongruous and unſuitable to the nature of that Feaſt, and to a participation of it: Or it is a receiving thoſe Conſecrated
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:40113:103"/>Elements with ſuch an unſuitable Mind as makes Men uncapable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that benefit which our Lord deſigned to be received by the uſe of that Ordinance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Not to <hi>diſcern the Lords Body</hi> in eating that Bread, and drinking that Cup, is, not to underſtand the Nature of that Ordinance, nor our Lords deſign in it; nor to be ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly affected with the Spiritual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and meaning of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is not to underſtand the Nature and End of that Ordinance. As when Men do not underſtand that the breaking the Lords Body upon the Croſs, and the ſhedding of his Blood as an Expiatory Sacrifice for the ſin of the World, is ſignified, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, and commemorated by the breaking of Bread, and pouring out of Wine in that Sacrament. And when they do not underſtand or diſcern that this Ordinance was appointed by our Bleſſed Saviour, for a perpetual Commemoration of his tranſcendent Love in dying for us.</p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:40113:104"/>
               <p>Now, if no more than this ſhould be meant by not diſcerning the Lords Body, Men of common Illumination in the things of the Goſpel, and by a common Faith concerning them, may undoubtedly eſcape being guilty of this unworthineſs in eating that Bread, and drinking that Cup. For it will not be denyed but that many unregenerate Men may in this ſenſe diſcern the Lords Body more clearly, and more diſtinctly, than many of the Regenerate themſelves can.</p>
               <p>And if, Secondly, by not diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lords Body ſhould be alſo meant (as I ſuppoſe it is) the unſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs of Mens Affection to the Spiritual Nature of the things repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by eating that Bread, and drinking that Cup; yet Men by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Grace may in ſome meaſure diſcern the Lords Body, by having ſome degree of Affection ſutable to the Spiritual Nature and Deſign of that Ordinance. In the ſenſe now under conſideration, Men do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Lords Body in receiving this
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:40113:104"/>Sacrament, when they are no more Affected with Love and Gratitude to our Bleſſed Saviour for his great Love in dying for us, than as if there had never been any ſuch thing ſuffered by him, and for ſuch an end as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the World.</p>
               <p>But now Men who have but <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itial</hi> Faith and common Grace, may eat that Bread, and drink that Cup of the Lord with a much more ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble frame of Mind and Affection, than this comes to. For they may at ſuch a time, and upon ſuch an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, have ſome ſenſe of Chriſts Love upon their Minds in dying for them, and ſome hope of being ſaved by his Death; and for that reaſon they may have ſome degree of Love and Affection to him ſtirring in them, even ſuch as may draw ſome grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acknowledgment of his Love from them, and ſome preſent purpoſes of Living more to him, ſuch as may cauſe them to ſin leſs, until that ſenſe is worn off. When our Saviour ſaith, <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother more
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:40113:105"/>than me, is not worthy of me,</hi> Mat. 10.37. He ſuppoſeth ſome may Love him to a degree, who yet love ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe more, and thereby make themſelves unworthy of the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is by him.</p>
               <p>Now, ſuch a ſenſe of Chriſts Love as this which Men but of common Grace may have at their coming to the Sacrament, has a very fair ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in it towards ſuch a ſenſe and ſuch Love which is ſaving indeed, and is in a very near Capacity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo improved as to become ſuch, and doubtleſs is ſo in many a one. For which cauſe ſuch ſhould be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to frequent this Sacrament as often as they have Opportunity, with the beſt Preparation they can make.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To <hi>be guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord,</hi> (as all they are, who eat that Bread, and drink that Cup unworthily, <hi>ver.</hi> 27.) can ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie no leſs, and it may be no more, than a being guilty of a Profaning of his Body and Blood by uſing and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:40113:105"/>receiving the Sacred Symbols and Signs thereof, with a frame of Mind altogether unſutable to what is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and repreſented thereby. And this Men are guilty of when they are no otherwiſe affected at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of the Death of Chriſt in the Sacrament, than as if his Death had been the Death but of a common Man, nor are no more Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the things repreſented by that Sacrament in the eating that Bread; and drinking that Cup, than as if they were but at a common Meal. They are thus guilty, when they are ſtupid, ſottiſh, and irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent at that Action, and void of an affecting ſenſe of the wonderful Love of our Saviour in laying down his Life for us; even then when they make uſe of that Ordinance which was purpoſely inſtituted to perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and preſerve a lively ſenſe of it in Chriſtians to the end of the World.</p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:40113:106"/>
               <p>This Profaning the Body and Blood of the Lord thus, is, as we may eaſily perceive, a ſin of the ſame Nature with that of not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Lords Body in eating that Bread, and drinking that Cup, and is <hi>reſolved</hi> into it, as <hi>all unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> receiving that Sacrament is, as it ſhould ſeem by St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words; when he aſſigns the not diſcerning the Lords Body, as the reaſon why Men at any time eat that Bread and drink that Cup <hi>unworthily,</hi> in the 29. <hi>ver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now Men by common Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and Faith, are very capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of diſcerning a great difference between the Perſon and Death of Chriſt, and the Reaſon and End of his Death, and the Perſon and Death of other Men; and between the reaſon of eating and drinking at the Lords Table, and their eating and drinking at other Tables; and of being otherwiſe Affected with theſe things than with common things.</p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:40113:106"/>
               <p>Conſidering then that the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy eating of that Bread, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Cup, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, conſiſts in ſuch an unſutable frame of Mind in doing ſo, as by reaſon of which Men do not diſcern the Lords Body, but Profane it and the facred Signs and Symbols of it: And conſidering likewiſe that the Apoſtle makes the danger of thus eating that Bread, and drinking that Cup unworthily, the reaſon of his Exhorting them to examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before they come to that Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; it is eaſie to underſtand what the Apoſtle would have them exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themſelves about in Order to their Communicating at the Table of the Lord. And it is about theſe things eſpecially as I conceive, <hi>viz.</hi> whether they underſtand the Nature of that Ordinance, and for what end our Lord did Inſtitute it. And whether they are like to find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Affected with a ſenſe of that great Love of Chriſt in dying for them, which is Repreſented and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:40113:107"/>Commemorated in that Sacrament: And whether they do not judge him moſt worthy of their Love and Thanks for ſuch Love of his to them: And whether they do not judge it fit and reaſonable that they ſhould live unto him, who dyed for them: And whether and how far they do endeavour to do ſo.</p>
               <p>And St. <hi>Paul</hi> had a little before his Exhorting them to examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, repreſented to them the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and End of that Ordinance ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its firſt Inſtitution, to the end they might examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by it, whether they had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions ſutable to it, and that they might the better know how to govern and demean themſelves in the uſe of it.</p>
               <p>Now, if after all this, we ſhould look into thoſe outward Acts of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, for which St. <hi>Paul</hi> greatly blames thoſe of this Church, telling them that their Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40113:107"/>in that manner, <hi>was not to eat the Lords Supper,</hi> and for which, and for not <hi>diſcerning the Lords Body,</hi> he ſays, that <hi>many were weak and ſickly among them, and many dead,</hi> we ſhall find that Men but of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Grace may eaſily avoid being guilty of like abuſes.</p>
               <p>The firſt Abuſe of this kind the Apoſtle takes Notice of, was their <hi>Schiſmaticalneſs</hi> in the uſe of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, by which they defeated in a manner one great end of it. In <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 17. he charges their coming together in their Church-Aſſemblies, to be <hi>not for the better, but for the worſe.</hi> And this he did upon this account, becauſe when <hi>they came together in the Church, there were Diviſions among them,</hi> ver. 18. And in <hi>ver.</hi> 20. he told them, That <hi>this was not to eat the Lords Supper,</hi> to Communicate ſo dividedly as it ſeems they did. For in <hi>ver.</hi> 21. he ſaith, <hi>every one taketh before other his own Supper.</hi> By which
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:40113:108"/>words conſidered with their relation to the Context, ſeveral Authors have underſtood the Schiſmatical Practice of the ſeveral Parties into which that Church was divided, in Communicating apart one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For although they came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one place to do it, yet ſo, as that one Party made an end of their Communicating before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had begun theirs. I will inſtance in ſuch Authors for this againſt which the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> can have leaſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> upon the place in his Confutation of the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> Tranſlation of the New Teſtament, delivers his ſenſe thus. <hi>There was a double Abuſe among them: One in their Love Feaſts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>while that which ſhould have ſerved for the knitting the knot of Love, was uſed to cut the Cord thereof, in that every one as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf liſted, made choice of ſuch as he would have to ſit at Table with him, the other either not tarried for, or thruſt out when they came, eſpecially the Root. The other Abuſe pulled in
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40113:108"/>by the former, was, for that thoſe which were Companions at one Table in the Common Feaſt, Communicated alſo in the Sacred with the ſame Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration and ſeveralty.</hi> Dr. <hi>Mayor</hi> ſaith thus: <hi>It ſeems this good Order was perverted among the</hi> Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>one Company being of one Sect coming before another, and receiving the Lords Supper and this their own Supper, in a moſt ſcandalous manner departed; and then came another Company doing likewiſe.</hi> Mr. <hi>Sam. Cradock,</hi> in his Apoſtolical Hiſtory, <hi>pag.</hi> 72. delivers his ſenſe thus: <hi>In thoſe their Feaſts of Charity, at the end whereof the Lords Supper was Celebrated, they did not now obſerve the true Church Communion; but every one, that is, every Faction or Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion being come to the place of the Aſſembly, did preſently ſit down to eat what they brought in company of their own Party, not minding or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding others; whereupon this Holy Feaſt was neither Celebrated at the ſame time by all, nor in Holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:40113:109"/>contrary to the true <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of Chriſtians ſignified thereby.</hi> Unto which I might add the <hi>Dutch An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notators</hi> upon the place. <hi>Own Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that is, a Supper which is not held in Common of the whole Church, as the Lords Supper muſt be held, but which is held privately by ſome alone. Every one, that is, every one that held with them.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words in <hi>ver.</hi> 33, 34. ſeem ſtrongly to back the Interpretation and ſenſe of theſe Authors. His words are theſe; <hi>Wherefore my Brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one, for another, that ye come not together to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> Now, unleſs one Party had Feaſted and Communicated together before another, there would have been no occaſion for this Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of tarrying one for another; unleſs we could ſuppoſe that the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals</hi> did eat their own Supper and the Lords Supper <hi>ſingly</hi> and apart from all the reſt; which is no ways likely, ſo long as they had thoſe of their own Party to Aſſociate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:40113:109"/>with: That phraſe of their coming <hi>together to eat,</hi> ſhews they did not eat ſingly and apart.</p>
               <p>This Sacrament by tending to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken the ſenſe of Chriſts love to all his members, one as well as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by dying for them all, tends to Unite and Knit them all one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in mutual love, as co-partners together in the ſame benefits by his death, and to render them all dear one to another, becauſe they were ſo to him when he gave himſelf for them all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17. To uſe this Sacrament therefore as an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of diviſion as they did, was to pervert the end and uſe of it, and to Act contradictiouſly to the good and benefit which our Saviour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned his People by it.</p>
               <p>Conſidering then that their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating thus dividedly, was that which made their coming together to be, not for the better but for the worſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 17.18. and to be a coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:40113:110"/>for condemnation, <hi>ver.</hi> 33, 34. it highly concerns thoſe amongſt us who divide themſelves in their Sacramental communion from their Brethren, thorowly to review and examin the reaſons and grounds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they do it, leſt their coming together ſhould be found before God, to be a coming toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not for the better, but for the worſe, and a coming together to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
               <p>This Factious communicating of theſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the Apoſtle we ſee did inſiſt on more than on any other, their Sacramental abuſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating this, and concluding with a particular caution, and admonition againſt it; which is more than he did concerning any other of them.</p>
               <p>And yet this Schiſmatical com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating was ſuch as Chriſtians by vertue of common grace may eaſily avoid the like, as every one will grant.</p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:40113:110"/>
               <p>The other abuſes at their Feaſts of Charity, and at the Sacrament, were their neglecting and deſpiſing their poor Brethren, and ſuffering them to hunger, when at the ſame time they made themſelves guilty of intemperance and exceſs; <hi>one is hungry, another is drunk, deſpiſe ye the Church of God, and ſhame them which have not?</hi> Theſe alſo were ſuch unworthy Acts, as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans by common grace may eaſily keep themſelves from being guilty of the like.</p>
               <p>Now all theſe outward Acts of unworthineſs proceeded from their not rightly diſcerning the Lords Body, as we may well conceive, either as not underſtanding the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Ordinance, or as not being duly affected with what was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented and commemorated by it. And therefore for remedy for time to come, he puts them upon examining themſelves, concerning the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, the ſenſe and affection,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:40113:111"/>which Chriſtians ought to have touching thoſe things when they go to the Table of the Lord. I ſhall not proceed to ſhew how each of theſe external Acts of unworthy communicating proceeded from their not diſcerning the Lords Body, which yet might eaſily be done.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole matter I think we may conclude, that if men by exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation find themſelves in a capacity and diſpoſition, to anſwer our Lords end, in this his inſtitution, by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking at his Table in a grateful remembrance of him, that then they are not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and unworthy to be Communicants of it. For men receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment worthily or unworthily, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they do or do not thereby anſwer the end and deſign of it, in remembring our bleſſed Saviour.</p>

               <p>There are ſeveral things offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to our conſideration which ſeem to render it fit, and reaſonable, and well-becoming the wiſdom and goodneſs of God that it ſhould be ſo, and ſuch as render it highly uſeful and beneficial unto men. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe it tends more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to increaſe the number of Inviſible Church Members, than it would if none ſhould be admitted into the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, until they were of the Inviſible, or worthily reputed to be ſo. That it has this tendency, needs
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:40113:112"/>no better proof than the Experience the Church of God has had of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py effect of this way and method of converting men, above what has been produced in the other way. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence has made it manifeſt, that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant more thorow and ſound conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in men have been made <hi>in</hi> the Viſible Church than <hi>out</hi> of it, and <hi>after</hi> they have been baptized, than <hi>before.</hi> More in the Church of God have been made good, and that by means of their being in it, than have been made ſo before they were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into it. How rarely have any tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and ſound converſions been wrought in men while out of the Church ſince Miracles ceaſed? How ſeldom do we ſee or hear of any Jews, or profeſt Infidels become really holy and good men, tho they live among Chriſtians and where they have the opportunity of hearing the Goſpel if they had any mind to it? When as, thanks be to God, we have known or heard of multitudes of Converſions of this nature that have been wrought
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:40113:112"/>in men after they have been in the Church.</p>
               <p>If the Apoſtles in their time did by vertue of their Miniſtry convert many ſo as of bad to make them really holy and good, before they were received into the Church: Yet as their Calling was <hi>extraordinary,</hi> ſo was their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry by which thoſe Converſions were wrought; their Miſſion and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine being atteſted to come from heaven by multitudes of miraculous operations, and marvelous gifts. And therefore thoſe Converſions which were wrought by ſuch extraordinary means, muſt be looked upon as extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Converſions: And to argue from things extraordinarily done, to a neceſſity of having the like done in ordinary caſes, and under ordinary means, is ſo abſurd, and ſuch a piece of unreaſonableneſs, as thoſe we call <hi>Seekers</hi> are guilty of, who can find, as they think no true Churches extant or viſible, becauſe not called by men qualified with like extraordinary gifts as thoſe, or many of thoſe in the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40113:113"/>Apoſtles days were, by whom Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es were then gathered, And indeed, had not the means by which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles converted thoſe whom they did convert, been <hi>extraordinary,</hi> it would have been in a manner impoſſible for them to have ſucceeded in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking as they did, conſidering that they were to convert them from other Religions in which they had been edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and brought up, and which they had received from their Fathers and Fore-fathers, unto a new Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Chriſtian Religion, which was ſo greatly different from theirs as it was; eſpecially from that of <hi>Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm,</hi> from which moſt of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions probably were made.</p>
               <p>But when the Apoſtles had in this extraordinary way gathered our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour a Church all over the known World, and ſettled particular Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, it was not neceſſary, as the Event ſhews, that this extraordinary way of converting men ſhould be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For when by this extraordinary means of converting men way was
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:40113:113"/>made for converting them in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way, then that which was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ceaſed: Like as the giving the Iſraelites <hi>Manna</hi> from heaven cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed when they came into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and had opportunity of being ſupplied with food in an ordinary way. And from that time forward there have been but few Converſions made in thoſe without the Church, but moſt of thoſe that have been made in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men to the power of godlineſs, have been made upon thoſe within the Viſible Church.</p>
               <p>For tho God is pleaſed, I doubt not, to plant true ſaving grace in ſome in their early days by the benefit of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Education: yet there are very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, who having been received into the Church by Baptiſm in their Infancy, have little or nothing more than a form of godlineſs (if ſo much) found in them when grown up. But among theſe there are many who in time are brought on, or converted to the Power of Godlineſs by means of their being in the Church, and under
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:40113:114"/>thoſe Ordinances of God there ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, by which he is wont to work ſaving grace in men. This is Gods ordinary way of Converſion, ſince that which was extraordinary ceaſed: And ever ſince that time, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the Converſions that have been made in men to a ſaving Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith, and to a faithful practice and the Power of Chriſtianity, have been made upon perſons baptized and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church.</p>
               <p>And altho the Converſion of men to Chriſtianity by the Miniſtry of the Apoſtles was extraordinary, becauſe wrought in an extraordinary way, and by extraordinary means, as I have ſhewed: yet we have great reaſon to think that thoſe Converſions, or many of them that proved effectual at laſt, were but only beginnings, and preparatory to a ſecond and thorow Converſion of them while they were yet without the viſible Church, and were carried quite through, and made effectual after they were brought into the Church by Baptiſm.</p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:40113:114"/>
               <p>And the manner of the Apoſtles writing to the Chriſtians after they had been in the Church for ſome time, ſeems to intimate that the Apoſtles themſelves had no other apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe Converſions, or many of them. For we find them earneſtly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading thoſe Chriſtians to put away ſuch practices, the retaining of which could not well conſiſt with a thorow and ſound converſion: Which argues, that at leaſt many of them had not yet put them off, tho they had been for ſome time in the Church. Thus Col, 3.8, 9. <hi>But now ye alſo put off all theſe; anger, wrath, malice, blaſphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth. Lie not one to another, ſeeing ye have put off the old man with his deeds:</hi> That is, they had engaged to do ſo in Baptiſm. See the like again, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.3. And 1 Pet. 2.1. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laying aſide all malice, and all guile, and hypocriſies, and envies, and all evil ſpeakings; as new-born babes deſire the ſincere milk of the Word, that ye may grow thereby.</hi> 1 Cor. 6.15. <hi>Know ye
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:40113:115"/>not that your bodies are the members of Chriſt? Shall I then take the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, and make them the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of an Harlot? God forbid. What, know ye not that he that is joyned to an harlot; is one body?</hi> Chap. 10.21, 22. <hi>Ye cannot drink the Cup of the Lord, and the Cup of devils: Ye cannot be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Lords Table, and of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Devils? Do we provoke the Lord to jealouſie? Are we ſtronger than he?</hi> Chap. 15.33, 34. <hi>Be not deceived; evil communications corrupt good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Awake to righteouſneſs and ſin not; for ſome have not the knowledge of God: I ſpeak this to your ſhame.</hi> 2 Cor. 6.16, 17. <hi>What agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols? For ye are the Temple of the living God. Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye ſeparate, ſaith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you,</hi> Chap. 12.20, 21. <hi>For I fear leſt when I come, I ſhall not find you ſuch as I would, and that I ſhall be found unto you ſuch as ye would not: leſt there be debates, envyings, wraths,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:40113:115"/>ſtrifes, backbitings, whiſperings, ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, tumults: and leſt when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I ſhall bewail many which have ſinned already, and have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of the uncleaneſs, and fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and laſciviouſneſs which they have committed.</hi> Phil. 2.22. <hi>All ſeek their own, and not the things of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So by the general Epiſtle which St. <hi>James</hi> wrote, not to any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church, but to the twelve Tribes ſcattered abroad, it appears that he was very jealous and ſuſpicious that the faith which very many of the Chriſtians had, was but <hi>a dead and unavailable faith,</hi> and ſuch as would neither juſtifie nor ſave them: becauſe it was but a barren and unfruitful faith, ſuch as did neither purifie the heart, nor reform the life, <hi>being hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the Word, and not doers.</hi> For for all their knowledge and their faith, it ſeems by the tenour of his writing, that their luſts remained ſtill luſty and ſtrong, that warred in their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: The love of pleaſure, their
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:40113:116"/>unworthy compliances to keep friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the World, pride, envy, and grudging one againſt another, ſtrife, and contention, and uncharitable judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and condemning one another, and provoking one another with their unruly Tongues, and curſing and ſwearing, and ſuch like diſtempers it ſeems did abound among them. And St. <hi>James</hi> by this Epiſtle to them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours their thorow Converſion; and encourageth the ſincere among them to endeavour it likewiſe, ſaying, <hi>If any ſee his brother err, and one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert him: Let him know that he which converteth a ſinner from the error of his way, ſhall ſave a ſoul from death, and cover a multitude of ſins.</hi> And when we likewiſe find that there were but a few names in <hi>Sardis</hi> but what had defiled their Garments, having indeed a name to live, but were dead; and nothing which our Saviour could commend in all the Church of <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea:</hi> I ſay, when we find this, and conſider all theſe things, and more of like nature in the Apoſtles Writings,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:40113:116"/>we have great reaſon to think that many of thoſe whom the Apoſtles baptized, were not thorowly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted till after they were brought into the Church, and yet many ſuch were ſo after.</p>
               <p>And indeed I do not know what other reaſon can be given why the Apoſtles made ſuch haſte as they did to baptize perſons after they had once gained their conſent to turn Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, without ſtaying for any farther trial, but that they thought their thorow Converſion was more likely to be effected within the Church than without. It is one thing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from a falſe Religion to a bare or notitional belief of the true, and another thing to be converted from that to a right practical belief of it. There were ſome who did believe in the former ſenſe through the power of conviction, and could do no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, who yet had no mind to become obedient to the Rules and Precepts of the Goſpel in all things. Such were thoſe <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.23. and thoſe <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.42, 43.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:40113:117"/>and ſuch was <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and ſuch were thoſe, of whom St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks, that had but a dead faith: And thus it is with many that are of the Viſible Church in theſe days, who have no other faith for ſome time, and yet afterward are converted to a lively practical belief of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And it is probable, that the faith of moſt of the Apoſtles Converts went little or nothing farther than to a general belief of the truth of the Apoſtles Doctrine until after they were baptized; they having ſo little time of learning before as generally they had, but were carried on further to a more particular diſtinct and practical belief by after-teaching when they were in the Church. And this is not diſagreeable to what I have formerly noted from the words of our Saviours Commiſſion to his Apoſtles touching a double teaching; the one to make men become Diſciples, which went before Baptiſm, the other to direct them how to live as Chriſtians, which followed after it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20.</p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:40113:117"/>
               <p>But however, whatever thorow and effectual Converſions the Apoſtles might in an extraordinary way effect in men while they were without the Church for the firſt founding of the Chriſtian Church; yet we are ſure that ſince that extraordinary way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion has been diſcontinued, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly more have been converted by their being in the Church, and by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the means of converſion which they have there enjoyed, than have been among thoſe without the Church. And this is the firſt reaſon aſſigned why others ſhould be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Viſible Church than ſuch as are of the Inviſible, or than are reputed to be ſo before ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another reaſon why we may conceive Almighty God allows many others to be of the Viſible Church than are of the Inviſible, is, becauſe ſo to do is more uſeful for the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating and ſpreading of the Chriſtian Religion in the World, than the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting and reſtraining the Viſible
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:40113:118"/>Church only to thoſe who are of the Inviſible alſo, can be. For it cannot be denied but that ſuch gifts, and ſuch common grace as will not be ſufficient unto a mans own Salvation, may yet be very uſeful for the maintaining and defending the Chriſtian Doctrine againſt Adverſaries, and for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing others in it, and for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading them to believe it, and to live according to it. Which was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I ſuppoſe, why St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, that <hi>he rejoyced, and would rejoyce that Chriſt was preached, tho it were but inſincerely by ſome,</hi> as well as for being preached <hi>in truth by others,</hi> Phil. 1.18. For the more men of Parts, and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of Intereſt among men the Chriſtian Religion and ſound Doctrine has to aſſert and defend it, and the more there are of others to abet and encourage them in it, (though many of them ſhall be ſuppoſed to be mainly influenced therein by motives of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar honour and intereſt) the more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in general, and the more reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it will have in the World, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:40113:118"/>the further it will ſpread. As we ſee on the contrary, the more Popery has had men of parts, and learning, and of intereſt otherwiſe to promote and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate it, the more and the farther it hath ſpread and prevailed in the World: And the ſame is true of other Errors and Hereſies, as that of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm</hi> when time was. There is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but the more good men are backt in their promulging ſound and ſaving Doctrine by men of great intereſt in the World, that agree with them in Doctrine and ſubſtance of Worſhip (tho they ſhould not in all reſpects be ſo hearty and ſincere as the other are,) the more Chriſtian Religion gains among men.</p>
               <p>And if all ſuch as theſe ſhould be made enemies to the Church by being denied to be of it, the Churches power of propagating the Chriſtian Religion would quickly be thereby exceedingly weakened, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation thereof greatly obſtructed. We have not now Miracles, the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary means by which Chriſtianity
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:40113:119"/>was at firſt propagated; without which it is not probable the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and blind world would have been reconciled to it upon account of its own intrinſick excellency and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And therefore there is now the more need of the help of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to propagate the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Not only of ſuch as are of the Inviſible Church, and Viſible likewiſe, but alſo of thoſe who are but only of the Viſible. The ſucceſs in propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the Chriſtian Religion, does not wholly depend upon the moral goodneſs of the Inſtrruments by whom it is done, but ſo much upon its own goodneſs, that if that be but ſufficiently diſcovered, tho but by men defective in their Morals, it is yet able to commend it ſelf very much unto the choice of men. <hi>If they had ſtood in my counſel, and had cauſed my people to hear my words, then they ſhould have turned them from their evil ways,</hi> ſaith God concerning the falſe Prophets, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.22.</p>
               <p>It is no ſmall matter upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:40113:119"/>to be born within the Pale of the Viſible Church of Chriſtian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and to be educated in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, though by Parents too much ſtrangers to the power of it. <hi>And of Zion it ſhall be ſaid, this and that man was born in her, The Lord ſhall, count when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there,</hi> Pſal. 87.5, 6. How many worthy Children has the Church had, and of great uſe in it, who yet have been born of Parents of but ſmall account for Religion, So that ſuch mens being of the Church, is of great uſe for the propagating of truly religious men, and by them the Chriſtian Religion. But if ſuch men as theſe had been deprived of Chureh edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by their Parents being deprived of Memberſhip in the Viſible Church, the Church in all probability would have been deprived of ſuch uſeful Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as theſe prove to be for the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating of the true Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another reaſon may be, becauſe to take others into the Viſible Church than ſuch as are, or are credibly reputed
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:40113:120"/>to be of the Inviſible, tends much more to the ſecurity of the Inviſible Church in the world than the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all ſuch would do. For were it not for thoſe of the Church as Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible over and beſides ſuch as are of it as Inviſible, thoſe which are of the Church as Inviſible would be in much more danger than now they are, of being devoured by thoſe numerous enemies which they have in the world. <hi>Chriſts Flock is but a little flock</hi> comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and there are but <hi>few that find the narrow way that leads to life,</hi> as he hath told us. And ſo he hath told us alſo in the Parable of the Sower, that of <hi>four</hi> ſorts of hearers of the Goſpel, there is but <hi>one</hi> that brings forth fruit: And in another place, that among the many that are called, there are but <hi>few choſen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then, if when with the help of thoſe of the Viſible Church which are not of the Inviſible, (which yet according to the Scriptures ſeem to be far the greater number) thoſe of the Inviſible Church have enough to do
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:40113:120"/>to ſubſiſt in the world without being rooted out of it by the Enemies of Chriſtianity, as we ſee they have, what can we think would become of them but ruine without a ſtanding Miracle to ſecure them, if thoſe who are but only of the Viſible Church were made Enemies alſo to thoſe of the Inviſible, as doubtleſs they would if they ſhould all be rejected by them as none of Chriſts Church on earth? How unable would they be to defend themſelves againſt the Popiſh Party in the world, if they were not aſſiſted by thoſe who are but of the Church as Viſible? Or how unable would they be to defend themſelves againſt all thoſe that are Enemies to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity both name and thing, if the bulk and body of men, which are Chriſtians only in outward Form and Profeſſion, did not ſtand as a ſcreen between them and thoſe enemies?</p>
               <p>Our Saviour hath declared that the Wheat would be in great danger of being rooted up if the Tares ſhould for the preſent be gathered out of it;
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:40113:121"/>and for that reaſon <hi>would have both to grow together till the harveſt,</hi> Mat. 13. Our Saviour did not intend hereby (no more do I by what I have ſaid) to put a bar againſt purging the Church of Capital Offenders by Diſcipline, and therefore by <hi>Tares</hi> its probable he meant carnal Goſpellers that yet are not obnoxious to Excommunication, ſuch as the thorny-ground hearers, in whom the Cares of this world, and the deceitfulneſs of Riches, and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fures of this Life, choak the Word which they have received, and which they profeſs, ſo that it brings forth in them no fruit to perfection.</p>
               <p>But before I proceed any farther I muſt remove an Objection, which otherwiſe lies againſt the uſe which I here make of this Parable of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. And the Objection is this; That this Parable makes nothing againſt gathering the bad from among the good in the <hi>Church,</hi> but from among the good in the <hi>World;</hi> Not that they ſhould both grow together in the Church till Harveſt, but in the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:40113:121"/>World. And to ſtrengthen this they alledge our Saviours interpretation of this Parable, where he ſays, that the <hi>Field</hi> where the Tares and the Wheat grow together, is the <hi>World,</hi> Mat. 13.38.</p>
               <p>And this indeed at firſt ſight ſeems to be a very conſiderable Objection. But if we conſider the matter well, I think it may appear otherwiſe. The <hi>Field</hi> indeed in which the Seed was ſown, and the Goſpel firſt prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, was the <hi>World,</hi> according to our Saviours Commiſſion to his Apoſtles; <hi>Go ye into all the world and preach the Goſpel,</hi> Mar. 16.15. But then thoſe that received this Seed of the Goſpel, ſo as to make profeſſion of adhering to it, were preſently baptized and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Church. Now it was among theſe that the Tares ſprang up, many of them proving bad Chriſtians. So that the Seed was firſt ſown in the World as in a common field: But yet the Tares ſprang up in that part of the world which was now become the Viſible Church, and an encloſed
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:40113:122"/>Garden. And therefore when the time of the Harveſt ſhall come when theſe Tares muſt be ſeparated from the Wheat, our Saviour ſays, <hi>They ſhall be gathered out of the Kingdom of the Son of Man,</hi> Ver. 41. where they were permitted to grow till this Harveſt. And what is this Kingdom of the Son of Man, but his Viſible Church? The Hiſtory of the Event of the Apoſtles Preaching, does plainly lay open the meaning of this Parable, and that of the Draw-net, and other like Parables, in that the Viſible Church which they gathered out of the world, conſiſted of bad as well as good.</p>
               <p>And this Parable in particular ſhews further that theſe Tares were not to be gathered out of the Church, for this very reaſon, <hi>Leſt while ye gather up the Tares,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ye root up alſo the Wheat with them.</hi> So that it ſeems that the Tares growing with the Wheat is in ſome reſpect matter of ſecurity to the Wheat, and that the Wheat would be in more danger by the Tares being gathered from among
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:40113:122"/>it, than by their growing together with it: in more danger of bein rooted up, or rooted out. And this ſeems fully to juſtifie and make good that reaſon I am now upon, why all unregenerate Chriſtians ſhould not be denied a place and being in the Viſible Church.</p>
               <p>If it ſhall be hear ſaid, that the Church in the Primitive times, when but few in number, did yet ſubſiſt, yea, and abundantly increaſe too, tho they had no humane or worldly Power to defend them, and when al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the whole world both of Jews and Gentiles were againſt them: And why may it not as well do ſo now, tho none that are not of the Inviſible Church ſhould be any defence unto it.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that there is no doubt but that they might ſubſiſt in the world, continue and increaſe as well as they did, provided they had but the ſame extraordinary means to back and abet them, and to increaſe their numbers, as thoſe Primitive Chriſtians had: I mean thoſe miraculous Powers which then procured the Chriſtians great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:40113:123"/>among the People, and which did ſtill attract and draw in more to their Party than were diminiſhed by the Perſecution which was raiſed againſt them by the higher Powers which were then Infidel. For by reaſon of thoſe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous wonders which were done by the Apoſtles and others in thoſe times, the multitude of People were ſo aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and affected, that they favoured them ſo far as that the Rulers were put under ſome awe. For we read that for the reaſon aforeſaid, <hi>great grace or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour was upon them all,</hi> to wit, all the Chriſtians, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.33. And Chap. 5.13. its ſaid, <hi>that the people magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them.</hi> So that the Rulers when they had otherwiſe a mind to it, <hi>found not how to puniſh them becauſe of the people, for all men glorified God for that which was done,</hi> Chap. 4.21. And in <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.26. its ſaid of the Captain and Officers that were ſent to bring the Apoſtles before the Council, <hi>that they brought them without violence, becauſe they feared the people leſt they ſhould have been ſtoned.</hi> And by reaſon
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:40113:123"/>of the credit they obtained among the people both to themſelves and their way by the numerous Miracles they wrought; <hi>believers were the more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women</hi> notwithſtanding all the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which was made againſt them by the Rulers, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.14. And that wonderful increaſe of Believers which was made from among the Heathen alſo, was attributed by St. <hi>Paul</hi> unto thoſe Signs and Wonders that were wrought for the proof and confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Chriſtian Way, <hi>I will not dare,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to ſpeak of any of thoſe things which Chriſt hath not wrought by me to make the Gentiles obedient by word and deed, through mighty Signs and Wonders by the Spirit of God,</hi> Rom. 15.18, 19.</p>
               <p>But if the ſmall number of ſincere Chriſtians that are in the world, had no other means to preſerve themſelves and to increaſe their number but the goodneſs of their Cauſe, and their own Innocency, and were not counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced and protected by Chriſtian
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:40113:124"/>States and Governours, and by a multitude more of the ſame Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with themſelves than are of like ſincerity in that Profeſſion; they would be in great danger of being in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner extirpated out of the world by the Inſidel and Antichriſtian Parties in it. When the Papal defection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel the Church within the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, the greateſt part perhaps of the then Viſible Church in that part of the world, fell off from the Orthodox and ſincere, and became their Enemies in time. The conſequence of which was the exterminating and rooting out of that part of the world, in a great meaſure, the Orthodox and ſincere Chriſtians. Which is a great inſtance to ſhew how it would fare with thoſe of the Inviſible Church, if they were deſerted by thoſe Chriſtians which are not of it, or if thoſe were rejected as no fellow-members of the Viſible Church, and thereby made their Enemies.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another reaſon is taken from the danger in another reſpect of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:40113:124"/>reckoning none of the Church as Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, but upon the reputation of their being of the Church as Inviſible: For to admit men upon no other terms into the Viſible Church, nor to its Communion, but upon the reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and under the Notion of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already of the Church as Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, tends greatly to betray many Souls into a dangerous ſnare of ſelf-deceiving. For, if this rule of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion ſhould be obſerved, many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes would be committed either through fallibility or partiality of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in them that admit them; and ſo, many would be received into the Viſible Church, or to the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it as Members of the Inviſible, which yet are not of it. And if ſo, then all thoſe which are thus received under the approbation of the Viſible Church as Members of the Inviſible, will be thereby <hi>ſtrengthened</hi> in their <hi>ſelf-flattery</hi> and good opinion they have of themſelves touching their good and ſafe condition, when there is no ſuch matter. And when they
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:40113:125"/>find the good opinion they have of themſelves thus ſtrengthened by the publick judgment of the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with them therein, they will be under the greater temptation, and in ſo much the greater danger of reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſecurely in that unſafe condition, to the great hazard of their Souls. We know, or have abundant reaſon to ſuſpect, that many that have but a Form of Godlineſs, are <hi>Laodicean</hi> like, leſs apt to ſuſpect the goodneſs of their own condition before God, than they that are truly ſincere: How much leſs will they ſuſpect it, and how much more will they be confirmed in the good opinion of themſelves, tho falſe, when they have the publick judgment of the Church to back them in it, and that after inſpection has been made into their lives, and ſigns of their Converſion approved of? As the manner is of thoſe that go that way.</p>
               <p>Of this danger, and of this great inconvenience, ſome of the <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Divines grew ſenſible after they
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:40113:125"/>had made trial of that way a great while. For in their anſwer to Mr. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venports Apologetical Preface, pa.</hi> 43, 44. they expreſs themſelves in theſe words: <hi>Indeed, when men confound theſe two, and do the Viſible Church Intereſt unto ſuch conditions and qualifications as are reputed enough to Salvation, this may tend to harden men, and to make them conceit, that if once they be but got into the Church they are ſure of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when as alas it may be they are far from it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now there is no ſuch danger does ariſe from mens being owned Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church Members from their profeſſing to believe the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and from their Covenanting to endeavour to live according to it. Such Profeſſion and ſuch Covenanting does indeed give ground of hope to the Church, that ſuch will not be ſo regardleſs of their own Salvation as not to be willing to learn their duty, and to endeavour to do it that they may be ſaved. But yet ſuch hope of the Church concerning their good
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:40113:126"/>performance for the future, does not miniſter any occaſion of confidence in ſuch men that they have <hi>already</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed what is neceſſary to their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as a receiving them into the Church, and unto Communion, as having in the publick judgment of the Church already performed it, would do. This act of the Church in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them into Communion in her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal priviledges in hope of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving them to the ſaving of their Souls, gives them no ground of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the ſafety and goodneſs of their condition thereby, further than they are careful <hi>to make their Calling and Election ſure by uſing all diligence</hi> in improving the opportunity and means of doing ſo by their being in the Church.</p>
               <p>Men are too prone to lay too great a ſtreſs upon their being received into the Viſible Church and Communion, tho the Church hath paſt no judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereby of their being of the Inviſible Church: how much more would they do ſo in caſe it had.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:40113:126"/>St. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſenſible, I doubt not, how prone many Chriſtians are to lay too much ſtreſs meerly upon their being of the Church, and partakers in the external Communion thereof; For which cauſe he cautioned the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans againſt flattering themſelves with an opinion of their ſafe condition upon that account, and laboured to poſſeſs them with a ſenſe of the danger they were in for all that, if they ſhould reſt therein without growing better and better thereby, 1 Cor. 10. <hi>I would not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that ye ſhould be ignorant, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, how that all our Fathers were baptized unto</hi> Moſes <hi>in the Cloud, and in the Sea, and did all eat the ſame ſpiritual meat, and drink the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual drink;</hi> and yet <hi>with many of them God was not well pleaſed, but overthrew them in the Wilderneſs.</hi> And he told them that theſe things were <hi>our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,</hi> to the intent that we ſhould not luſt after evil things as they luſted. Then enumerated their miſcarriages, and what befel them thereupon: and further told them, that theſe things
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:40113:127"/>hapned to them for Examples or Types to us, and were written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come. Thereby giving them to underſtand, that tho they were baptized and received into the Church, and did participate of the ſame ſpiritual meat and drink in the Sacrament with the beſt in the Church; yet if they did not take warning by the miſcarriages of thoſe that had been of the Church, and of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of it as well as they, to avoid the like, they might periſh as well as the other did, for all their Communion in the Church.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another reaſon againſt refuſing all ſuch Communion in the Viſible Church who are not judged to be of the Church as Inviſible, is taken from the danger of ſuch a practice in another reſpect, and that is the danger of miſtaking the good for bad, and of refuſing the ſincere Chriſtians under the Notion of Carnal and Unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. There is ſo little viſible diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between what many of the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:40113:127"/>ſame perſons were a little before they had ſaving grace, and what they are when they have it only in the loweſt degree; that men would be in great danger of miſtaking if they ſhould make a judgment of their ſpiritual ſtate under ſuch Circumſtances. And the difficulty of not miſtaking in this caſe will be ſtill increaſed, when that very little of true grace which is in ſome men, is greatly obſcured by the courſeneſs of their natural temper and diſpoſition. Beſides the prejudice which ſome good men have againſt others upon account of ſome difference in Opinion, will not ſuffer them to diſcern true grace in ſome of them in whom it is, and perhaps in ſome good degree too. This Age hath furniſhed us with too many inſtances of this nature. The like may be ſaid in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the <hi>narrowneſs of ſpirit, and ſeverity</hi> of many, by reaſon of which many of thoſe in whom God himſelf finds ſaving grace, would be refuſed Communion with the Church for want of it, if that opinion ſhould generally
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:40113:128"/>obtain, that none ſhould be admitted into the Viſible Church, ar to its Communion, but upon the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their being of the Church as Inviſible.</p>
               <p>Some do underſtand the danger of rooting up the Wheat if the Tares ſhould be gathered from among it to lie in the danger of miſtaking the Wheat for the Tares, if the one ſhould be attempted to be gathered from the other. And if this ſhould be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why our Saviour would have them both to grow together till the Harveſt, it would be pat to what I have ſaid on this reaſon. But if it be not (as I am apt to think it is not) yet then it ſo much the more confirms that to be our Savious meaning which I have ſuggeſted elſewhere; for I do not know any third ſenſe pretended to among Interpreters. But indeed there is danger in both reſpects: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I know no inconvenience if we underſtand the Parable in reference to both.</p>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:40113:128"/>
               <p>Now it is not hard to conceive how bad a thing it would be if ſuch as have true grace, ſhould be refuſed admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance into the Viſible Church, or to its Communion, only becauſe it is ſo little that men cannot diſcern it to be ſo. For ſuch a diſcouragement may be enough to ſet them back again, to <hi>quench the ſmoaking flax,</hi> and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to the loſs of that very little grace in its beginning which they have: A thing point blank againſt that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition and caution of our Saviour, Mat. 18.10. <hi>Take heed that ye deſpiſe not one of theſe little ones.</hi>

            <div n="11" type="query">
               <head>QUERY XI. <hi>WHat is it that makes the difference between the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church as Viſible, and particular Churches? And what makes the difference between one particular Church and another?</hi>
               </head>
               <p>The Query being double, I ſhall anſwer to that firſt which is firſt, and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:40113:129"/>do ſay, the Univerſal Church differs from a particular Church in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Univerſal Church differs from a particular, as the whole differs from a part, and a particular Church differs from the Univerſal, as a part differs from the whole. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they are materially the ſame, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with this difference, the one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all Viſible Church matter, and the other but a part of it. There is nothing neceſſary to qualifie the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of which a particular Church doth conſiſt, than what made all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it Members of the Univerſal Church, unleſs it be what belongs to the Officers of it as ſuch.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If by a particular Church we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand one ſingle Congregation, then a particular Church differs from the Univerſal as thoſe of which it does conſiſt do aſſemble together in one place for Publick Worſhip, which the Univerſal Church cannot do now, tho in the beginning of its exiſtence poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly it might. But if by a particular
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:40113:129"/>Church we underſtand ſo many ſingle worſhipping Congregations as are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under one and the ſame Church Government and Governours in a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Province, or Kingdom; Then a particular Church in this ſenſe is differenced from the Church Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal by this Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Polity</hi> under which it is otherwiſe united than the Univerſal Church, as ſuch, is or can be. And ſuch a particular Church we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Church in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> and in other great Cities to have been, the Scripture ſo accounting them, when yet each of them conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of more ſingle worſhipping Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies than one, as may well be preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med on ſeveral accounts, not here to be mentioned.</p>
               <p>There is another thing which the Congregationaliſts make eſſential to the being of a particular Church (for they make it the Form or formal cauſe of it) which would be another diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Univerſal Church and a particular, if their Opinion and Aſſertion were admitted concerning it,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:40113:130"/>and that is that <hi>Church Covenant or mutual engagement to walk together in the way and order of the Goſpel.</hi> And by this each one of their ſingle Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations diſtinguiſheth it ſelf from all other. And they account this ſo neceſſary, as to make it a condition of Communion without which they will not admit perſons otherwiſe well approved of by themſelves to Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Communion, that is, unleſs they are under this engagement to them or ſome other Siſter Church of the ſame kind.</p>
               <p>But this is ſo much the worſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is done and required under the Notion of Divine appointment, when God has appointed no ſuch thing. Which is ſuch a piece of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition as the enjoyning the uſe of the Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is free from, ſo long as they are not enjoyned as things of divine appointment, but only as of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different nature, and therefore there is no ſuch reaſon to ſcruple them as there is to ſcruple this practice upon thoſe terms.</p>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:40113:130"/>
               <p>There are two Texts of Scripture upon which more eſpecially and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally they ground this opinion and practice of theirs; which I ſhall a little enquire into. The one is 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. which Dr. <hi>O.</hi> to this end quotes more than once in his late Book; the words are theſe: <hi>And this they did, not as we hoped, but firſt gave their own ſelves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.</hi> The <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> here in the Text, are St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timotheus,</hi> from whom this Epiſtle came, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.1. And if ſo, how could the Churches of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia's</hi> giving themſelves to St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> poſſibly ſignifie their mutual Covenanting one with another among themſelves? And is it not as ſtrange alſo that they ſhould give themſelves to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> in order to the Conſtituting themſelves Churches, when as that giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, was done then when they were already Churches, as the whole Context from <hi>ver.</hi> 1. doth ſhew. And if their giving themſelves to <hi>Paul</hi> and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:40113:131"/>
                  <hi>Timothy</hi> was one of thoſe things which they did, more than <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> hoped for, then ſuch a confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not likely to be meant by it as was eſſentially neceſſary to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence as Churches; this certainly would not have been more than they hoped for, if it had been their duty, and of ſo great a neceſſity. This is enough to ſhew how impertinently this Scripture is alledged. But the whole Context ſhews that the things St. <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeaks of, were quite of another nature, and that is the liberality of the Churches of <hi>Macedonia</hi> towards the relief of the Chriſtians of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and their zeal in being otherwiſe ſerviceable to ſo good a work, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they did indeed exceed the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy.</hi> For their Poverty to which they were brought by ſuſtering for the Goſpel was ſo deep, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> it ſeems ſcarce thought it fit to receive any thing of them, and it was upon their earneſt intreaty that he did; and yet they did not only thus give above their ability, but
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:40113:131"/>beſides their giving up themſelves to God as ready to ſuffer further for him if called to it, they gave up themſelves to St. <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Timothy</hi> alſo to aſſiſt them in that charitable work they had in hand, by their further endeavours to promote it among others. For they <hi>intreated</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Timothy <hi>earneſtly, to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the fellowſhip of miniſtring to the Saints,</hi> the managing of that affair, and procured them to ſend <hi>Titus</hi> to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> to promote the ſame buſineſs as appears by <hi>ver.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>This Scripture though ſo great a ſtranger to this opinion as you ſee, yet is that which ſo far as ever I could perceive, is chiefly depended upon in this cauſe. They bring in alſo, as favouring their notion and practice, the ſaying of St. <hi>Peter</hi> to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; <hi>ye alſo as lively ſtones are built up a ſpiritual houſe an holy Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Pet. 2.5. And they do, it ſeems, ſuppoſe that theſe living ſtones being ſo laid together as to to make a ſpiritual houſe, is done by their Confederation and Covenant, as
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:40113:132"/>the <hi>Cement</hi> by which the Chriſtians were united and combined in one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, <hi>fitly framed together,</hi> as the phraſe is, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>But St. <hi>Peter</hi> is not here ſpeaking to any one particular Church as ſuch, when he ſays ye are built up a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual houſe, but to <hi>the ſtrangers ſcattered abroad throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Aſia, and Bethynia,</hi> as appears <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.1. And no one ſurely can think that theſe Chriſtians thus ſcattered, and at this diſtance, could become one particular Church by ſuch a mutual Confederation as theſe hold neceſſary for the forming a particular Church. And if not, it muſt be by vertue of ſomewhat elſe than ſuch a particular Church Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant as theſe diſſenting Brethren thought to find here, by which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in ſo many diſtant parts of the world, as aforeſaid, were built up one ſpiritual houſe. And that doubtleſs muſt be the ſame thing by which all Chriſtians in the world become one ſpiritual houſe of God; for ſo they
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:40113:132"/>are. For when Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>High Prieſt over the houſe of God,</hi> Heb. 10.21. <hi>And to be faithful as a Sen over his own houſe,</hi> Heb. 3.6. Houſe in theſe places cannot ſignifie leſs than the Univerſal Chriſtian Church, who are called <hi>the houſhold of faith.</hi> And how do all theſe Chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the houſe of God, but by being joyned and devoted to him by the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal Covenant, and thereby to one another, among whom he dwells and is Worſhipped as in his holy Temple: For by this they all become one body, which is but another Metaphor under which to expreſs the ſame thing, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.21, 22. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13.</p>
               <p>It is the ſame thing which makes perſons Members of the Church Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, that qualifies them for parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church Memberſhip; and that is the Baptiſmal Covenant. And to make any other Covenant beſides this ſo neceſſary to qualifie men for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church Memberſhip and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, as to make this of Gods own appointment inſufficient for that
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:40113:133"/>end, is a great impeachment of it, and contains in it ſuch conſequences as the Abetters of it would be aſhamed to countenance if they were aware of it. For ſo long as it is aſſerted to be of divine appointment; the <hi>formal cauſe</hi> of a particular Church, and <hi>eſſential</hi> to its being, and is made the <hi>Condition</hi> of Communion when God has no where appointed or required it: ſo long it may be charged with theſe evils.</p>
               <p n="1">1. With a <hi>teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of men,</hi> a piece of vain Worſhip condemned by our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9. which is the ſame thing with <hi>adding</hi> to Gods Word, or a <hi>ſaying he ſaith,</hi> when he <hi>hath not ſaid it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is in ſome ſort and in part a making void the Command or Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of God, that men might eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh their own Tradition. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Baptiſmal Covenant qualifies men for particular Church Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip by bringing them into the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church, this Opinion denies
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:40113:133"/>the Baptiſmal Covenant to be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to this end, and ſets up this other confederating in its room.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It contains in it the Unchurching of all thoſe Goſpel Churches that are, or ever have been in the world, that have not been thus united by Church Covenanting. For to ſay this is the Form of a particular Church, or the formal cauſe of it, is in effect to ſay, that none are really Churches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; for Matter and Form are eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the being of Churches as well as they are of other things. Now to Unchurch all Churches that have not been thus confederate, is <hi>a great thing indeed,</hi> if we conſider how few years it is ſince ſuch Covenanting was heard of in any Chriſtian Church in the world, and by how inconſiderable a number of Congregations it has been uſed ſince it has been heard of. Theſe things conſidered, it is matter of a very venturous and daring nature.</p>
               <p>As for the other part of our Enquiry, touching that which makes the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between one particular Church
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:40113:134"/>and another, we may conceive of it thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It conſiſts partly in that which does diſtinguiſh one Town from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or one great Neighbourhood from another, and that is the bounds of Habitation. And this diſtinction is as well convenient, yea, neceſſary for <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Order, and peaceable Government, as it is for <hi>Civil,</hi> and does as well accommodate the ends of the one as of the other. and without this, a peaceable and orderly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the whole Church would be impracticable, even as it would be in an Univerſal Empire: And thus the Churches planted by the Apoſtles, are differenced and diſtinguiſhed one from another; that at <hi>Rome</hi> from that at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and that at <hi>Epheſus</hi> from that at <hi>Philippi;</hi> yea, that at <hi>Cenchrea</hi> from that at <hi>Corinth,</hi> which yet bordered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Corinth,</hi> and ſo of the reſt. And indeed that difference which is made between Church and Church by Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Neighbourhood and Cohabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, does beſt anſwer the ends of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:40113:134"/>particular Church Aſſociation, ſuch as is aſſembling together for Publick Worſhip, and mutual aſſiſtances in all Chriſtian offices of Brotherly love and friendſhip. But this alone does not conſtitute Chriſtians dwelling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame place, a particular Chriſtian Church, tho by their being of the Church Univerſal, they are as fit matter qualified for it. But</p>
               <p n="2">2. That which does conſtitute ſuch to be a particular Church, as that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a company of Chriſtians in Local Communion in Divine Worſhip, conſiſting in the participation of Goſpel Ordinances, is the placing over them one or more Church-Officers, to miniſter to them therein. By which Officers, as well as by the place where they dwell, and where they aſſemble for Worſhip, they are diſtinguiſhed from other like Churches under the Conduct of other Church-Officers of the ſame kind. For by ſuch their joynt Local Communion in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip adminiſtred by their ſpiritual Guide or Paſtor, they are united with
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:40113:135"/>him and among themſelves, as one Worſhipping Congregation; by which Union alſo they are diſtinguiſhed from other particular Churches, as other particular Churches in like manner are from them.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of the Independent Church-way do indeed hold particular Churches, as ſuch, to be Antecedent to any Church-Officers over them. Which is the reaſon which Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> in his <hi>Inquiry concerning Churches,</hi> does al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to prove the Power of the Keys to be given to the Church. And to prove particular Churches to be Antecedent to Church Officers, he quotes <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. where it is ſaid of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas; And when they had ordained them Elders in every Church,</hi> &amp;c. As for this proof of his Aſſertion, I ſhall conſider it by and by; but ſhall firſt examine and try what is in the Aſſertion it ſelf, which I am inclined to think will be found full of miſtake, and that the contrary will be found true, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Miniſtry is, and always has
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:40113:135"/>been Antecedent to the exiſtence of Chriſtian Churches, and indeed an inſtrumental cauſe of their being. And this is true, not only of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches, but alſo of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church as Chriſtian, which yet in order of nature is Antecedent to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches. The gathering of Chriſt a Chriſtian Church in the world at firſt, was the effect of the Apoſtolical Miniſtry and the Miniſtry of their aſſiſtants. The Church <hi>is built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Chriſt being the chief corner ſtone,</hi> Eph. 2.20. and the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is Antecedent to the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure. All the additions that have been ſince made to the Viſible Church. have been by the Miniſterial Office, by letting all the particular Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that addition into it by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
               <p>And when men are ordained Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel, they are not ordained Miniſters of this or that particular Church, but Miniſters of Chriſt to the Church in general,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:40113:136"/>
                  <hi>Let no man glory in men; for all things are yours; whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, all are yours, and ye are Chriſts,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.21, 22. <hi>Paul, Apollos,</hi> and <hi>Cephas</hi> were theirs in common with others, not theirs appropriately. And their being ſent or called to be Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to this ot that particular Church, is but the application of their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral capacity to particular uſe and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, to wit, that of Miniſtration to ſuch a people in particular. And this Miniſterial Power they bring with them to the Church or People among whom they are placed, but do not receive it from them: And it is by virtue of their Miniſtry and Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that a particular Body of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can act or perform any Publick Acts of Communion peculiar to a Church as ſuch. And therefore as they cannot act as a Church without ſuch a Miniſtry, ſo neither can they properly be a Church without it. The firſt thing St. <hi>Paul</hi> mentions, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11.12. for which our Saviour Chriſt gave Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:40113:136"/>Paſtors and Teachers, was for the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of the Saints,</hi> or for the <hi>joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them together,</hi> or for the <hi>making them up,</hi> or for the <hi>compacting or knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them together:</hi> For thus variouſly is that word rendred by Expoſitors; but all to the ſame ſenſe. For it is for the knitting them and holding them together as one body in their ſeveral Publick Aſſemblies for Worſhip and Edification. And indeed a Church is ſo called from ſeveral Chriſtians aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling together for Publick Worſhip, their Union wherein is made by their joynt concurrence with their Spiritual Paſtor in his Miniſtration; for which end and purpoſe ſuch Officers are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and appointed by Chriſt, as the words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> now alledged ſhew.</p>
               <p>And now as for the Text alledged by the Doctor, in which <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> are ſaid to have ordained Elders in <hi>every Church,</hi> Acts 14.23. this does not prove the Churches there ſpoken of to be ſuch Antecedently to any Miniſterial Act or Power by which they became ſuch. For they had
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:40113:137"/>been made Churches in ſome ſort by the planting of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> who alſo as Church Officers miniſtred to them while they were among them: For this ordaining Elders in every Church by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> was done in their return to the places where they had preached the Goſpel, and made Diſciples before; and they returned to them to confirm them, and to ordain Elders among them, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the two precedent verſes compared with the Text it ſelf. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, St. <hi>Luke</hi> did not write this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory till after the Apoſtles had thus ordained Elders in the Churches men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by him, ſo that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Churches then when he wrote thoſe words, and it was proper for him to ſtile them ſo, tho it ſhould be ſuppoſed they had been none before they had Elders ordained in them. So that this Text can be no proof of that for which the Doctor doth alledge it.</p>

               <head>QUERY XII. <hi>WHether from the reaſon of the</hi> extent <hi>and Latitude of Viſible Church-Memberſhip and Communion which has been diſcourſed of, the great uſefulneſs of a National ſettlement or Conſtitution for the publick exerciſe of the Worſhip of God in all parts of a Nation profeſſing Chriſtianity, may not fairly be inferred and concluded?</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Now the reaſon why Viſible Church-Memberſhip &amp; Communion are better in reſpect of their due extenſiveneſs, than they would be if the terms and conditions of enjoying thoſe Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges were limited and reſtrained to the ſame terms which the enjoyment of Inviſible Church Memberſhip and Communion are, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe theſe Priviledges under ſuch an <hi>extent and latitude,</hi> tend more to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the Chriſtian Religion, and the increaſe of the number of thoſe
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:40113:138"/>who ſhall be ſaved, than they would or could do if they were limitted and reſtrained to the ſame terms and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of enjoyment as Inviſible Church Memberſhip and Communion are. This hath been ſhew'd in our tenth Inquiry.</p>
               <p>And it is for the ſame reaſon that it is better that the exerciſe of Gods Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip ſhould be ſet up in all parts of a Nation profeſſing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity by a <hi>National Authority;</hi> and that all ſuch Profeſſors ſhould be thereby obliged to frequent it, than it is to leave all ſuch to their own liberty to promote and frequent it, or to forbear and neglect to do ſo, as the way called <hi>Independency</hi> does. For the National way tends more to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate and promote the knowledge and practice of Chriſtian Religion, and the Salvation of Souls, than the Congregational way does, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt needs be abundantly better. That it does ſo, is too appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to be denied by any that have but common reaſon when theſe
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:40113:138"/>things following are but duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Better proviſion is made by a publick eſtabliſhment for the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch a Nation in the way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, than can reaſonably be expected without it. Unleſs proviſion were made by publick Authority for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of a Goſpel Miniſtry in all parts of a Nation, there would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be a greater want of a publick Miniſtry in many places of it, than by reaſon of ſuch a publick proviſion there is. Would people, think we, of themſelves in all places of a Nation provide a better maintainance for the Miniſtry of the Goſpel among them, if left wholly to themſelves, than there is made by publick Authority? If they would, how comes it to paſs that thoſe places are generally worſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with Miniſters where the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick has made leaſt proviſion for their maintainance? And generally where there is the greateſt failure in this, there is the leaſt face of Religion, and greateſt hazard of mens Souls.
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:40113:139"/>
                  <hi>Where there is no Viſion the people periſh,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 29.18. <hi>And the people are deſtroyed for lack of knowledge,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the people ſhould be all left to themſelves to chuſe what Miniſters they pleaſe without any publick ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and allowance of ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by publick Authority to judg of their fitneſs, many would be in danger of chuſing men of erronious Principles, and ſuch as would corrupt the minds of men. The conſequence of which would be great oppoſition and contention between the Orthodox and the Erronious, and making of Parties, and endleſs ſtrife, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Peace and Charity, and to the hurt of mens ſouls thereby, and to the great diſhonour of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to the hinderance of its good effects upon the minds and lives of men.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Altho the Publick Worſhip ſhould be ſet up in all places of a Chriſtian Nation, yet if men ſhould
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:40113:139"/>be under no Obligation by Law to attend it, it would doubtleſs be much more neglected by many, than when there is. But the more men are brought to attend the means by which God works Grace in them, tho it be but by virtue of the Law they are brought to it, yet the more hope and probability there is of their being ſavingly wrought upon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If whoſoever ſhall pretend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf qualified for it, ſhould have liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to gather a Congregation, it would be the leaving open a door of oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to Seducers to ſubvert mens Souls, and to fill a Nation with varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Sects, and the miſchievous effects of them. And yet ſo it would be if there were no publick Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Church to reſtrain men: And to this day we feel the very ſad effects of ſo great a liberty ſometime indulged.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee for what reaſon true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſhould be promoted by National Authority. And as to matter of fact it is ſufficiently known, that thoſe
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:40113:140"/>who have had the Supream Power in all Nations have been wont always to promote by their Authority that which they have thought to be the true Religion whether it hath been true or falſe: And whence comes this but from the light and Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which directs men to uſe the Power and Intereſt they have to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Worſhipping of the God whom they ſerve. And indeed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of all peſuaſions are willing enough to have the Civil Power to exert it ſelf in furthering their own way of Worſhipping God: The People of <hi>New England,</hi> who once were as much for Liberty of Conſcience as any, yet ſoon found it convenient to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate the Civil Power with the Eccleſiaſtick for the defence and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of their Religion.</p>
               <p>Now as the great uſefulneſs of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional eſtabliſhment for the purpoſes aforeſaid, does ſufficiently appear from the reaſon and nature of the thing it ſelf, and has the light and law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on its ſide; ſo it is not deſtitute
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:40113:140"/>of countenance from ſupernatural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When Almighty God ſaid to <hi>Abraham, Thou ſhalt be a Father of many Nations, a Father of many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have I made thee,</hi> Gen. 17. He declared his intention of Reforming the world by degrees from Idolatry and falſe Worſhip in a <hi>National way,</hi> if we may judg what he intended to do afterwards, by the firſt inſtance he gave of his performance herein; and if we may judg of the true meaning of this as of other Divine Predictions, by the after Events which anſwer them in point of fact; which yet is the beſt and moſt approved way of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Predictions, when ſuch events take place.</p>
               <p>Almighty God made <hi>Abraham</hi> firſt a Father of a Nation which iſſued out of his own Loyns. For when his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, who by Circumciſion Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted to take <hi>Abrahams</hi> God only for their God, grew very numerous in <hi>Egypt,</hi> God brought them out thence that they might worſhip him
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:40113:141"/>openly and publickly in a National way. And by this means, and by his viſible owning them for his people by extraordinary favours ſhew'd them, he deſigned to make himſelf more known to the reſt of the world, to be the only true God, and to be ſo acknowledged.</p>
               <p>Now in that <hi>Abraham</hi> was promiſed to be the Father of many Nations, it was not ſo much for that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that many Nations ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend out of his Loyns by natural ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, as that many Nations in time ſhould, after his example, come to acknowledge and worſhip him only for their God as the only true God. For ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> underſtood this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he makes <hi>Abraham,</hi> in reſpect of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in the true God, to be the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all Nations that ſhould be of the ſame belief, as well thoſe of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion</hi> as that which was of the <hi>Circumciſion, as it is written,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I have made thee a Father of many Nations,</hi> Rom. 4.16, 17. And it was
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:40113:141"/>in this ſpiritual or religious reſpect and ſenſe that St. <hi>Paul</hi> had before in this Chapter aſſerted <hi>Abraham</hi> to be the Father of all that ſhall believe in the true God as he did, in all Nations, as well thoſe who were never Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, as thoſe that were, <hi>Ver.</hi> 11, 12. And thus God made <hi>Abraham</hi> a <hi>bleſſing</hi> to the World as he promiſed he would, and a Father of Nations, not only for that the Meſſias was to be born of one deſcended from him; for ſo he was born of one that deſcended from <hi>Abrahams</hi> Predeceſſors and Succeſſors, as well as from <hi>Abraham:</hi> But he was a <hi>bleſſing</hi> to the World, and the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Nations</hi> by being made by God the Head, the beginning and great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of reforming the World from Misbelief and Idolatry, and other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent evils, ſo as his Progenitors were not. To encourage which work in the world, God inveſted <hi>Abraham,</hi> that led the way herein, with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of being counted the Father of Nations, and a publick bleſſing to the world, both in himſelf and in his Seed.</p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:40113:142"/>
               <p n="2">2. That God did deſign farther to carry on the reformation of the world from Misbelief and Idolatry in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional way, and in that way to bring the world by degrees to the Worſhip of the true God only, appears by other Predictictons of the Prophets, ſuch as that, <hi>Iſa. 55.5. Behold thou ſhalt call a Nation that thou knowſt not, and Nations that knew not thee ſhall run unto thee.</hi> Chap. 52.15. <hi>He ſhall ſprinkle many Nations, the Kings ſhall ſhut their mouths at him,</hi> Chap. 49.23. <hi>Kings ſhall be thy nurſing fathers, and their Queens thy nurſing mothers.</hi> Zech. 8.22. <hi>Many people and ſtrong Nations ſhall come to ſeek the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Chap. 2.11. <hi>Many Nations ſhall be joyned to the Lord in that day, and ſhall be my people.</hi> The formal nature of mens Viſible Church-Memberſhip conſiſts in their being <hi>viſibly joyned to the Lord,</hi> as I have ſhewed; and therefore when many Nations are <hi>Nationally joyned</hi> to the Lord, they may well be counted Nationally his people, or Churches.</p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:40113:142"/>
               <p>And Nations are then Nationally joyned to the Lord, when Nations do incorporate the Chriſtian Religion with their Civil Government, and make it part of the National Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the Eccleſiaſtical Polity of the Jews together with the Judicial Law of that Commonwealth was. And by this means the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion becomes commodiouſly and with more certainty to be tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to future Generations in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as practiſed for the time being by that which is exiſtent; juſt as the Jews Religion was. <hi>For he eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed a teſtimony in Jacob, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Law in Iſrael, which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded our Fathers that they ſhould make them known to their Children: That the Generation to come might know them, even the Children which ſhould be born: who ſhould ariſe and declare them to their Children,</hi> Pſal. 78.5, 6.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Propheſies fore-mentioned concerning Nations being joyned to the Lord, referring to times under
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:40113:143"/>the New Teſtament, the event of them, as we ſhall ſee, will ſhew that they foretold Chriſtian Nations their being joyned to the Lord <hi>Nationally,</hi> or in the courſe of National Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And the nature of Events which anſwer to divine Predictions, are, I think, the beſt and moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Expoſitions of thoſe Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies when they are fulfilled, and the beſt meaſure which can be taken for the underſtanding of them.</p>
               <p>Two things then would be enquired into touching the Events we ſpeak of.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What, and which they are which we may reaſonably pitch upon for thoſe Events.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How we may be aſſured from ſome Scriptures of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that thoſe Events of Providence which we ſhall pitch upon, are indeed of that ſort and kind which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies we ſpeak of point us to.</p>
               <p n="1">I. For the firſt of theſe, we have very great reaſon to believe that thoſe National Reformations from Paganiſm
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:40113:143"/>and Judaiſm, and thoſe National Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations from Popery which have been made in the world ſince the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion was firſt ſet on foot, and which ſhall yet farther be made, are thoſe very <hi>Events,</hi> or the chiefeſt part of them, which the Propheſies, before ſpecified, point us to. We cannot ſay that any Reformation of either kind has been National, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it has been back'd by National Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Its true, there have been great multitudes of men during the ſtanding of the Roman Empire as Pagan, that were recovered from Judaiſm and Paganiſm to Chriſtianity; and there were many famous Churches of ſuch: But I think no one Nation, as ſuch, could be ſaid to be joyned to the Lord in all that time, tho out of many Kindreds, Tongues, and Nations, there were many, very many both men and women that were. But Nations then became Nationally the Lords when the Chriſtians in them were owned as ſuch, and required to behave themſelves as ſuch by the Supreme Authority and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:40113:144"/>ruling powers of thoſe Nations; tho there might poſſibly be many in thoſe Nations at the ſame time, which yet did not ſo much as pretend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But let us inquire in the ſecond place what aſſurance we have from any of the holy Writings of the New Teſtament, that thoſe National Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations from Paganiſm and Popery that have been made in New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment times, and which ſhall further be made in other Nations, are thoſe Events of Providence which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies, touching National converſions, point at. And to this end let us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That at what time the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power of the Roman Empire fell into Chriſtian hands, and was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for the deſtruction and root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out Pagan Idolatry, and for the ſetting up and eſtabliſhing the Publick Worſhip of Almighty God and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, throughout its Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: Then it was that this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or Dominion became Gods
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:40113:144"/>Kingdom in Scripture account. For to this great turn of Affairs in the judgment of the moſt approved Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of the <hi>Revelations</hi> does that joyful acclamations refer which we have ſet down in <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.10. <hi>Now is come Salvation, and Strength, and the Kingdom of our God, and the Power of his Chriſt,</hi> At which time alſo, <hi>the great Dragon, called the Devil and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, was caſt out, and his Angels with him,</hi> ver. 9. that is, thoſe Rulers ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and ſubordinate, who had till then done his work in promoting the Intereſt of the Kingdom of darkneſs by ſupporting Idolatry, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Chriſtians; as it was ſaid, <hi>The Devil ſhall caſt ſome of you into priſon,</hi> Rev. 2.10.</p>
               <p>But was not Gods Kingdom come into the Empire till now that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was made Chriſtian by the Emperour being a Chriſtian? Were there not many great and famous Chriſtian Churches within the Empire while the Government of it was Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in reſpect of Worſhip? Why, yes
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:40113:145"/>there was. Why then was not the Kingdom of God and the Power of his Chriſt ſaid to be come till the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the hands of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Emperour became Chriſtian? Why ſhould this Song, <hi>Now is come ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſtrength, and the Kingdom of our God, and the power of his Chriſt,</hi> be applied to this great turn of Affairs in the Empire, rather than to that when the Preaching of the Goſpel was firſt ſet on foot in it, and many Chriſtian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations erected? There can no other reaſon hereof be given. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, but that all the while the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Empire, in reference to Religion, was engaged for the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of the Viſible Kingdom of the Devil, ſo far, and in this reſpect it might be ſaid to be his Kingdom, to be ſure it could not be ſaid to be Gods ſo far as it was imployed againſt him. But when the Government of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Chriſtian, and engaged it ſelf in throwing down the Kingdom of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Worſhip of falſe Gods, and in ſetting up and eſtabliſhing the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:40113:145"/>Publick Worſhip of the true God, and the Chriſtian Religion; then and from that time in this Scripture account, that Kingdom or Empire became the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God and of his Chriſt, tho ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Inhabitants of it continued ſtill for a time at leaſt, Idolaters as to their profeſſion and private practice.</p>
               <p>So that when, and ſo long as the Government of the Empire in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution in reference to Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued idolatrous, ſo long the Empire it ſelf was not owned for Gods Kingdom, tho there were many <hi>Chriſtian Churches</hi> in it: but when once the Government of it became Chriſtian, it was then owned for Gods Kingdom, tho many of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of it were no Chriſtians. From whence it follows, &amp; may naturally be inferred, that in Scripture Notion King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms are ſaid to be Gods Kingdoms up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of a National Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Idolatry and falſe worſhip, when ever it is made by the publick Government and authority of ſuch Nations.</p>
               <p>But now after this Reformation
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:40113:146"/>from Paganiſm by the Imperial Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Power, in proceſs of time therecame <hi>a falling away</hi> in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire from the purity of Chriſtian Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, unto a Worſhip of a mixt nature, made up partly of a Worſhip given to the true God, and partly of a Worſhip given unto Creatures which is due only unto God; which was done by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing of the <hi>Papal</hi> Apoſtacy. And the <hi>ten Kings</hi> mentioned <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. into whoſe hands the Empire became divided, <hi>gave their power and ſtrength unto the Beaſt</hi> for the ſupport of this impure Worſhip and Pagan-like Superſtition.</p>
               <p>But after this had been done and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in for ſeveral hundreds of years, ſeveral of thoſe Kingdoms and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities, which had before given their power and ſtrength unto the Beaſt, fell off, and reaſſumed that power and ſtrength, and then devoted it to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God in reforming their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions from Popery, and in reſtoring the Publick Worſhip of God throughout their Dominions without any Idolatrous mixture. Upon which great turn of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:40113:146"/>thoſe <hi>great voices in heaven</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſaying, <hi>The Kingdoms of this world are become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt,</hi> Rev. 11.15. For this joyful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation is here brought in upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the Reſurrection and Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Witneſſes in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpoken of, and of the fall of a tenth part of the City ſpiritually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Sodom and Egypt.</hi> By which we underſtand that the fall of part of the Papal Power and Juriſdiction, and the riſe and exaltation of the Witneſſes, were <hi>contemporary;</hi> and that this great alteration and change in ſeveral Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, made thoſe Nations which were but Kingdoms of <hi>this world</hi> before, to become the Kingdoms <hi>of our Lord, and of his Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now there are theſe two reaſons to induce us to believe that this Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Witneſſes, and the fall of a tenth part of the City, refer unto the great Reformation from Popery, which was made many years ſince in ſeveral Kingdoms and Principalities in Chriſtendom, and conſequently that
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:40113:147"/>the acclamation aforeſaid (the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of this world, are become the Kingdoms of the Lord and of his Chriſt) refer unto the ſame time and thing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe we have no where ſo great, ſo notable, and remarkable an alteration as that Reformation made in Chriſtendom, foretold and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly pointed at in this Book of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies, if it were not in this. And yet it ſeems incredible that ſo great and famous an alteration of Affairs in the Popiſh State, and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church as that Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made, ſhould not in ſpecial be pointed at ſomewhere in this Book of Propheſies. This reaſon the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Dr. <hi>More</hi> hath ſurniſhed me with in his Appendage annexed to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>Daniels</hi> Propheſies, <hi>p.</hi> 291. With whoſe Expoſition, of what I here alledge out of <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. I am abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſatisfied as I find it in the foreſaid Appendage, and in his Book entituled, <hi>The Revelation of St.</hi> John <hi>unveiled.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:40113:147"/>
               <p n="2">2. The matters which ſell out and were tranſacted in and by that Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maton, did exactly anſwer to that which was foretold by that Propheſie touching the Reſurrection of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and the fall of the Popiſh power and intereſt in a conſiderable part of the Popes Juriſdiction. For then there was a <hi>Political</hi> Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that ſort of men who had been <hi>Politically</hi> ſlain, and a long time dead, for crying down Popery. And this was done when ſuch were put into publick imployment in all Reformed Nations. And at the ſame time on the other hand, there was a <hi>Political</hi> ſlaughter of <hi>thouſands of men,</hi> when all thoſe that had been in Office and holy Orders in their Church, were put down in all thoſe Nations that then became reformed. And this reaſon methinks ſhould convince any unprejudiced man, that our firſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py National Reformation from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery in ſeveral Nations, was the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of that Propheſie touching the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Witneſſes we ſpeak</p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:40113:148"/>
               <p>And if it were, then I cannot ſee how any can deny but that thoſe voices in heaven which preſently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed thereupon, did declare that thoſe Nations which while Popiſh, were but Kingdoms of this World, yet by their National reformation from Popery they became the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But if the Propheſie concerning the Reſurrection of the Witneſſes ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer unto another time and turn, and not to that of the firſt National Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Popery, yet that ſaying, <hi>The Kingdoms of this world are become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt,</hi> upon the occaſion there foregoing, will no leſs ſerve to prove that Nations by their National Reformation from Popery, became the Kingdoms of God, than it would in caſe that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie had referred unto the firſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Reformation from Popery. For the Reſurrection of the Witneſſes, the Earthquake, the fall of a tenth part of the City, and <hi>Political</hi> ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>ſeven thouſand of names of men,</hi>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:40113:148"/>muſt needs import a great alteration of Affairs and National Reformation, whereſoever and whenſoever they fall out, be it ſooner or later; becauſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it we ſee ſome of thoſe Nations which were but Kingdoms of the world before, do then become the Kingdoms of God. And if Nations of the world <hi>indefinitely,</hi> become the Kingdoms of God by being reformed from Popery or Paganiſm, ſo as to make the right Chriſtian Doctrine and Worſhip, the Religion of thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by National Authority; then the ſame is true of <hi>all Nations</hi> which are ſo reformed at any time, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of thoſe which led the way, and have been firſt in ſuch Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And thus our proof appears every way pregnant.</p>
               <p>To conclude this matter then; when we find that in all times and places in point of fact, that as faſt as the Sovereign and Supreme Power in each Nation has fallen into Orthodox Chriſtian hands, ſo faſt thoſe Nations have become reformed from Paganiſm
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:40113:149"/>or Popery by the Governing Power of thoſe Nations: And when we find again that by ſuch Reformations, thoſe Nations have become Gods Kingdoms as contradiſtinguiſhed from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of this world; great reaſon we have to believe theſe to be the very and true Events, and the fulfilling of ſuch ancient Predictions of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, as thoſe which foretold that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nations ſhould be joyned to the Lord, and be his People.</p>
               <p>It is true, it was a great while after Chriſtianity began, before it became National by National Authority, as it was long after <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity became the People of God by the Covenant of Circumciſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they and their Religion became National: And as the one was in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage four hundred years under the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Tyranny, ſo were the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians three hundred years under the Tyranny of the Pagan <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, before they and their Religion became National by National Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. But as the Chriſtian Religion
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:40113:149"/>and Worſhip as reformed, has ſince the Reformation been carried on principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a National way, ſo I doubt not but that it will be carried on farther, and more Nations come to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed from Popery, Infidelity, and Paganiſm, until at laſt that ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of the Angel by <hi>Daniel</hi> comes to be fulfilled, which tells us, <hi>That the Kingdom, and Dominion, and the greatneſs of the Kingdom under the whole heaven ſhall be given to the people of the Saints of the moſt High, whoſe Kingdom is an everlaſting Kingdom, and all Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi> (or Rulers as it is in the Margin) <hi>ſhall ſerve and obey him,</hi> Dan. 7.27. And that alſo in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72, 11. <hi>All Kings ſhall fall down before him; all Nations ſhall ſerve him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now from what hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to us in the foreſaid Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of St. <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 11. we may briefly obſerve theſe two or three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That notwithſtanding any <hi>leſſer defects</hi> in Doctrine, Worſhip, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment Eccleſiaſtical, in any of the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:40113:150"/>National Reformations from Popery which have been made, yet after and becauſe ſuch Reformation has been made, thoſe Nations are in Scripture account eſteemed the Kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chriſt, as oppoſed to the Kingdoms of this world. Which ſeems to me to fall ſomewhat hard up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch as <hi>ſeparate</hi> from the publick Worſhip of God eſtabliſhed in ſuch Nations by National Authority, in a way of National Reformation; and on thoſe more eſpecially who ſeparate from that Worſhip for that very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe enjoyned by National Authority. It likewiſe falls hard upon them alſo who diſeſteem, or leſs eſteem a <hi>National Miniſtry,</hi> becauſe it is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, or made ſuch according to a National eſtabliſhment. Theſe ſeem to be of one mind, and Almighty God of another, when he eſteems Nations to be joyned to him, and to be his People by that, for which they ſeparate.</p>
               <p>Their pretence that in the Apoſtles times, and for three hundred years
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:40113:150"/>after, the Affairs of the Church were carried on only in a free Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional way in greater or leſſer volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Aſſociations, and therefore they ought to be ſo now, ſeems very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable. Becauſe what was done in that kind then, was done by way of neceſſity, becauſe they had not opportunity of a better. Not but that they long'd for, and pray'd for ſuch Kings as would uſe their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Power for the propagation and furtherance of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as well as for the defence of it, and the Profeſſors of it. And they eſteemed it no ſmall favour from God, when at laſt they obtained it in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> a Chriſtian <hi>Ceſar,</hi> who uſed that Power of his for the eſtabliſhing the Chriſtian Religion and Worſhip of the only true God, and for the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and regulating many things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the more commodious and orderly carrying on the miniſtration of the Goſpel and the Worſhip of God. And therefore the people of God then exiſtent in the Empire, are
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:40113:151"/>brought in by the Spirit of Propheſie, expreſſing themſelves thus upon that occaſion: <hi>Now is come ſalvation, and ſtrength, and the Kingdom of our God, and the power of his Chriſt,</hi> as I ſhew'd before, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may be juſtly queſtioned, whether it be worth the while for men to diſpute againſt the being of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church in New Teſtament times, conſidering that in the New Teſtament, Nations reformed from Paganiſm and Popery, are ſtiled Gods Kingdoms: And conſidering likewiſe, that the Scripture ſtiles the ſame peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and in the ſame reſpect, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of God, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times his <hi>Church.</hi> And therefore it ſhould ſeem no more improper to call a Chriſtian Nation a Church of God, than it is to call it a Kingdom of God, which yet the Scripture ſtiles ſo.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It may be obſerved yet farther, That the Kingdoms or Nations which have been reformed from Popery, were before ſuch reformation was
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:40113:151"/>made, <hi>but Kingdoms of this world,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding much of what pertains to the Chriſtian Religion, was then owned and profeſſed in them. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God by whom the book of <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> was indited, we ſee ſtiles them ſo in their <hi>unreformed</hi> ſtate: <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of this world are become,</hi> &amp;c. Yet they then in their unreformed ſtate, Worſhipped the true God, and his Son Chriſt Jeſus: They owned the holy Scriptures for the Word of God, and uſed the ſame Creeds which the Reformed Churches themſelves uſe; and yet we ſee they are in that ſtate ſtiled by the Spirit of God, but King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of this world, when as under their reformed ſtate, they are ſaid to be the Kingdoms of God and of his Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Like as Almighty God for the like reaſon eſteemed the Nation of the Jews, who had been his own Church and People, but as <hi>Ethiopians unto him,</hi> Amos 9.7. and told them by another Prophet, <hi>Ye are not my people, and I will not be your God,</hi> Hoſ. 1.10.
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:40113:152"/>For tho they had his Ordinances among them, and boaſted of their Temple-Worſhip, crying, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord are theſe;</hi> yet at the ſame time <hi>they burnt Incenſe unto Baal, and walked after other Gods,</hi> Jer. 7. they divided their Worſhip between the true God and <hi>Baal,</hi> and did <hi>ſwear by the Lord and by Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cham,</hi> Zeph. 1.5. And upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it was that God ſaid of them by his Prophet, <hi>they are unto me as a ſpeckled bird,</hi> of a Religion of ſeveral colours, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.9. For this ſpiritual Whoredom eſpecially it was, that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God who had once eſpouſed that people to himſelf, gave them a Bill of Divorce at laſt, brake up houſe, turned them out of doors, and ſent them out of his Land, untill they ſhould repent and reform. And if we compare theſe things with the ſpiritual whoredom wherewith Myſtical <hi>Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> is charged, and for which, with other heinous crimes, ſhe is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this Book of <hi>Revelations,</hi> it will
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:40113:152"/>not be at all hard to conceive why Nations while Popiſh, are ſtiled and eſteemed but Kingdoms of this world.</p>
               <p>And this, if there were no other, is argument enough to prevail with all ſuch as would not be diſowned by God, to be none, or to become none of their Communion, who are thus diſowned by him.</p>
               <p>And thus we have ſeen how both from the light and law of Nature, the reaſon of the thing, and from divine Revelation alſo, the great expediency at leaſt of the publick exerciſe of Gods Worſhip in the way of National eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, is warranted, and approved of.</p>
               <p>This then may be a caution to men, who live in any ſuch reformed Nation as we have diſcourſed of, and as ours is, to take heed of acting in matters Eccleſiaſtical, or pertaining to Church Communion, as if they lived in a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh or Pagan Nation, by diſowning and by ſeparating from the National way of Worſhip, leſt thereby they
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:40113:153"/>diſcountenance and diſparage what God approves of, and diſown that for which God owns ſuch a Nation for his Kingdom. It is true, the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians, who lived in, Pagan Countries, and thoſe ſince which have lived in Popiſh, have been neceſſitated in duty to be ſeparate in their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Communion from their National Worſhip, as much as they were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not to be Idolaters. But there is a great difference between falſe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and defects in that which is true. The beſt Church Conſtitution, and the beſt Church Adminiſtration, which have men not divinely inſpired for the ordering of them, are liable to humane defects. And if humane defects even in Gods Worſhip, were not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured for the ſake of Communion in the Worſhip it ſelf, there could no ſuch thing as Church Communion be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed among Chriſtians, becauſe we cannot ſay there is any in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect ſtate in which we are, without defects.</p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:40113:153"/>
               <p>But then the queſtion will be what defects are to be indured in Gods Worſhip, rather than Communion in it ſhould be forſaken? and what are intolerable, and for the ſake of which Communion in the Worſhip is to be declined?</p>
               <p>And here it ſeems to me impoſſible warrantably to determine any defects intolerable which do not alter the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Worſhip, and make it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come falſe Worſhip; that do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy or defeat the ends for which true Worſhip ſerves. Who is he that will undertake to determine for what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, which are conſiſtent with Gods true Worſhip, Communion in that Worſhip is to be declined?</p>
               <p>But then the next queſtion will be, How we ſhall know what Worſhip is true, and what is falſe? And ſo what Worſhip it is that Communion in it is to be declined, and what not?</p>
               <p>Now that's falſe Worſhip which is given to a wrong Object, or to that which is not God. And that again is
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:40113:154"/>falſe Worſhip, tho given to God the right Object, when that which is not true matter of Worſhip, is given to him as matter of Worſhip.</p>
               <p>But how ſhall we know when Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is falſe in reſpect of the matter? Worſhip is then falſe in reſpect of the matter, when that is performed to God as required by him, which is not ſo. For ſo we are taught, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9. <hi>In vain do they worſhip me, teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of men.</hi> That's a vain or falſe Worſhip, when humane Ordinances are impoſed, and obſerved <hi>as</hi> the Commands of God; and this is the <hi>adding to his Word</hi> alſo, which is forbidden, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2.</p>
               <p>But then there is a great difference between theſe and the uſe of things in or about Gods Worſhip which are not of the Eſſence of it, nor uſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Notion of being commanded by God, but profeſſedly uſed as things indifferent in their own nature, and only as matters of Humane Prudence; and for this reaſon cannot juſtly be charged to be falſe Worſhip.</p>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:40113:154"/>
               <p>There is a great difference likewiſe between the Eſſence of Worſhip, and the Accidents of it, between the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſubſtance of it, and the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of external adminiſtration. There is not the liberty of varying in the one as there is in the other. As for inſtance, we are not left at like liberty in the choice of the Object, and matter of Prayer and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, as we are in the external man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of addreſs, nor limited by expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Rule in the one, as we are in the other. We are expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to pray to God in the name of Chriſt, and have expreſs direction for all the ſubſtantial parts or matter of Prayer, as Confeſſion, Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Petition, Thankſgiving, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion; but whether in a ſet Form, or without, whether with the uſe of a Book, or without, whether in one or more Prayers at a time, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kneeling or ſtanding, is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined; but in theſe we are left at liberty to uſe or chuſe as Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſhall direct or require. And
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:40113:155"/>the like may be ſaid concerning other parts of Gods Worſhip, Baptiſm, and the Lords Supper. The Ordinances themſelves are particularly command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but ſo are not ſeveral Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances relating to the external admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of them, but are left to the Prudence of Church Guides and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours under general Rules. And altho one way of external adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Worſhip may be better than another, and that may be choſen as beſt by ſuch as have power of chuſing, which yet is not beſt in it ſelf; yet ſo long as it does not alter the nature of the Worſhip it ſelf, nor defeat the ends and uſes to which an external adminiſtration ſerves, it can by no means be duly eſteemed to be falſe Worſhip. The worſt that can be ſaid of ſuch an adminiſtration of Worſhip which is not ſimply unlawful in it ſelf, but only inferiour in goodneſs unto the beſt, is only this, That it is inexpedient, when a better might have been had, if they had thought ſo by whom the choice was made.</p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:40113:155"/>
               <p>Now ſuppoſe then, that when the happy Work of National Reformation from Popery was laid and begun by the great Inſtruments of it, (whoſe memory is bleſſed, and name precious to good men.) Suppoſe, I ſay, they may poſſibly have been miſtaken in the betterneſs of ſome things in the external manner and form of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Publick Worſhip; yet ſo long as ſuch things do not amount unto any falſe Worſhip, but are only Imperfections in the true, the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will be, Whether it be prudent and becoming good men in this caſe to ſeek amendment of thoſe ſuppoſed defects, in any other way than in the ſame National courſe of proceeding by which the Reformation was firſt wrought. And the reaſon is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe God hath owned this way of Reformation by declaring Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon account of it to be his Kingdoms, which we cannot ſay he hath done upon account of any Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation wrought in them any other way without this.</p>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:40113:156"/>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe when ſuch a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is attempted in a Nation already reformed, in oppoſition to the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation eſtabliſhed by Law, it cannot reaſonably be expected, but that more hurt will be done thereby, than good obtained, as we have found by ſad experience in this Nation. For by this means a Nation comes to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt it ſelf, Party againſt Party, to the engendering <hi>diſaffection, envying, and ſtrife,</hi> and where theſe are, there is (as St. <hi>James</hi> hath told us) <hi>confuſion, and every evil work.</hi> And by this means there is a very ſenſible decay and loſs of that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the very life and ſpirit of Religion in men lies. But the Reformation in the external part of Worſhip, which is ſought after in this extraordinary way, is in things but of ſuch a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as wherein the life and ſpirit of Religion in men is little concerned one way or other, either as to loſs or gain. And therefore to chuſe to ſeek this ſort of Reformation in ſuch a way, as by which the loſs was likely to be
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:40113:156"/>far greater than the gain, and has ſince proved to be ſo, is a thing doubtleſs which cannot become the wiſdom of good men.</p>
               <p>Now that the Reformation in the external part of Worſhip which is purſued in the extraordinary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due way we ſpeak of, is in things but of ſuch a nature as wherein the ſpirit and life of Religion in men is little concerned one way or other, as to loſs or gain, appears by this, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe there have been, and are very many, who have lived under the uſe of that external Mode of Worſhip without any ſuch Reformation of it as is contended for, in whom the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and life of Religion has been found as much (as may well be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed) as in any other who have uſed any other Mode of Worſhip different from it. Not that I am againſt mens ſeeking that which they apprehend to be beſt in theſe matters, provided it be in the National way, and in ſuch a manner as that more hurt be not done by the way and manner of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:40113:157"/>ſeeking it, than good can be acquired in their way of obtaining it by ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is becoming rhe wiſdom of good men to ſeek the amendment they deſire, by complying as far as they can with what is already eſtabliſhed; becauſe by ſo doing, and by ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and humble application to the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative</hi> Powers of the Nation, they may in all reaſon ſooner obtain what is reaſonable and meet to be granted, than by ſeparating from it, and ſetting up another way in oppoſition to it. And the reaſon is, becauſe the one is apt to beget a good opinion of them, and of the innocency and goodneſs of their intention in what they deſire and ſeek: Whereas the other tends to exaſperate and provoke, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get an ill opinion of them, and a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of their deſigns, in the minds of thoſe from whom they expect eaſe and relief in what is mattet of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to them: And that which does that, is no good way of obtaining from them. <hi>Solomon's</hi> wiſe advice is,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:40113:157"/>
                  <hi>If the Spirit of the Ruler riſe up againſt thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.</hi> Eccleſ. 10.4.</p>

               </head>
               <p>To clear our way in this Inquiry it will be convenient to take notice of the difference that is between the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of the Catholick Church, and the <hi>Communion</hi> of it. The Union of the Catholick Church conſiſts in the ſame <hi>Relation</hi> which all the Members of that one Body bear to Chriſt the Head of it, and to one another as fellow-members: But the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this ſpiritual Corporation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a mutual performance of thoſe Chriſtian Duties and Offices to which they are engaged by virtue of that relation. By that Relation in which
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:40113:158"/>their Union conſiſts they come to have a greater intereſt in one another than they had before their incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration into that body; and by it they come under new duties to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to which they were not obliged before; But their Communion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts much in a mutual diſcharge of thoſe duties towards one another, and in an improvement of that intereſt for the benefit of one another, and the good of the whole by their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual intercourſe in ſpiritual affairs. The Union of the whole, which is made by one Baptiſm, or the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal Covenant, reſpects the <hi>being</hi> of the Church: But Catholick Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion reſpects its <hi>well-being</hi> by its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in wiſdom, goodneſs, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>There is indeed a Catholick Church <hi>

               <p>Having thus briefly conſidered how Catholick Communion differs from Catholick Union, I ſhall now proceed to ſhew a little more particularly wherein or in what Catholick Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion doth conſiſt. And we may beſt know what it is, and wherein it doth conſiſt by the account we have of it as practiſed in the Catholick Church when it firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Chriſtian. And this account we have in theſe words, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. <hi>And they continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles doctrine, and fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</hi> By which deſcription we ſee it conſiſted in their conſent and agreement in three things, <hi>Faith, Worſhip, Fellowſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In their agreeing in the ſame Faith; they continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles <hi>Doctrine;</hi> that is, in the belief of it, in attendance to it, and practice of it. From the ſame faith, being common to all Chriſtians, it is called, the <hi>common faith,</hi> Tit. 1.4. the <hi>one faith,</hi> Eph. 4.5. and their agreement in it, is ſtiled, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in the faith,</hi> Eph. 4.13.</p>

               <p n="2">2. In their agreement in the ſame Worſhip; <hi>breaking of bread and prayers.</hi> This Catholick Church in its beginning is ſaid to have continued <hi>with one accord</hi> in Prayer and Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.14. And on the day of <hi>Penticoſt</hi> they were all with <hi>one accord in one place,</hi> when the Holy Ghoſt was poured out upon them. And when their number ſo increaſed that they could not all perform this Publick Worſhip together in one place, but in ſeveral diſtinct Aſſemblies, called particular Churches, yet their <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in the ſame Worſhip, made their Communion in it but <hi>one Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> tho performed in ſeveral Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</p>
               <p>For altho theſe Aſſemblies be never ſo far diſtant from one another, yet ſo long as they all agree in the ſame Worſhip, the diſtance of place can no more hinder their Communion from being <hi>one,</hi> than their being baptized in ſeveral diſtant places, can hinder the Relation to one another contracted thereby, from being <hi>one,</hi> when it is
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:40113:159"/>common to all the Members. We account all thoſe to be of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at the ſame time, and in the ſame acts in which they hold their Local Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in ſeveral diſtant Nations, ſo long as they all agree in the ſame cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Worſhip. And there is the ſame reaſon for the Unity of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in Worſhip of all Orthodox Aſſemblies in all Nations. So that I take this for an unqueſtionable truth, That it is mens agreement in the ſame Principles of Communion, be they good or bad, that makes their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion but one, tho the particular acts of it are performed by them in many thouſand diſtant places.</p>
               <p>And now it is by the Union of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation by the Baptiſmal Covenant, and the Unity of Communion by agreement in the Principles of the Worſhip wherein they have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that all Orthodox Chriſtians make one great Houſe or Temple of God in the world, in which he is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worſhipped, and publickly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:40113:160"/>to be what he is, the one only true God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, in oppoſition to all falſe Gods, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.21. <hi>In whom all the building fitly framed together, groweth unto an holy Temple in the Lord.</hi> This is that houſe which is called <hi>Chriſts own houſe,</hi> Heb. 3.6. and that <hi>Houſe of God over which Chriſt is ſaid to be High Prieſt,</hi> Heb. 10.21. And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches in reference to this one houſe, are but as ſeveral Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in it, which all together make up one great houſe of God.</p>
               <p>And in this houſe of his God dwells, and therein manifeſteth himſelf to his People after a more ſpecial manner than he does to the world; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Ye are the Temple of the living God, as God hath ſaid, I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</hi> Here Almighty God meets with them, and communes with them, and receives their addreſſes; and here he entertains them with the <hi>fatneſs of his houſe,</hi> the Ordinances of the Goſpel, and the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:40113:160"/>benign influences and comfortable preſence of his Spirit in the uſe of them. In this way the whole Church in their ſeveral Aſſemblies have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with their Head Chriſt Jeſus, and one with another, by partaking in common of the ſpiritual benefits communicated by the Lord, and in aſſiſting in common in the Worſhip, Adoration, and Thankſgiving which the Church renders him for the glory and tranſcendent perfections of his nature and being, and returns him for all the bleſſings and benefits they receive from him.</p>
               <p>And the more all Chriſtians are agreed in their worſhipping of God, and in their Communion with him, the more they honour him, and the more they pleaſe him, and make themſelves the more capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving all good things from him in the greater abundance. If the <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but of two of them touching any thing they ſhall ask,</hi> hath his promiſe of granting it, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 18.19.) what might not be expected from him if
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:40113:161"/>the whole Church were of one heart and one ſoul, as they were at the firſt in matters of their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Catholick Communion conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth alſo in the mutual aſſiſtances which Chriſtians give to, and receive one from another, couched in that one word <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> in the deſcription of Catholick Communion, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. <hi>And they continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Doctrine, and Fellowſhip,</hi> &amp;c. The ſame word which in our Verſion is here tranſlated <hi>Fellowſhip,</hi> is by the <hi>Dutch</hi> in their Verſion tranſlated <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</hi> And according to Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> it ſignifies both to <hi>communicate,</hi> and to <hi>participate,</hi> to <hi>diſtribute,</hi> and to <hi>receive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that according to the nature of Chriſtian Communion, every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the whole Church is or ought to be uſeful and ſerviceable to the whole Community of Chriſtians in general, and to every Chriſtian in particular, ſo far as they can, in the place and rank in which the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:40113:161"/>of God hath ſet them. The which if duly obſerved by all as it ought to be, the ſame perſons that thus communicate and contribute aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to others, would be receiving back again from the whole, and from every Member in particular, the like ſuccour ſervice and aſſiſtance as oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity ſerves, as they themſelves had contributed to them: As a Chriſtian is to ſerve every fellow-Chriſtian, ſo according to the ſame Law every one is to ſerve him. This is that the Apoſtle means when he ſays, <hi>By love ſerve one another,</hi> Gal. 5.13. And this <hi>giving and receiving</hi> aſſiſtance, the ſame Apoſtle calls <hi>communicating with him,</hi> Phil. 4.15.</p>
               <p>If this Catholick Communion were but duly maintained among all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, how like a heaven upon earth would the Catholick Church be? And how happy would they be even now for the preſent that are of it? And how would the Inhabitants of the world that are not of it, then flow into it? And yet for Chriſtians thus
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:40113:162"/>to exchange Offices of love with one another, is nothing more than what we are all obliged to by the Royal Law of Love; <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> For if I am hereby bound to love every Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as my ſelf, ſo is every Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout obliged by it to love me as they love themſelves. And how delightful a commerce would this be, if the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church were but ſo happy as to hit on it!</p>
               <p>The particular duties and offices of love in which this part of Chriſtian Communion does conſiſt, are ſuch as theſe; the inſtructing and exhorting one another, the watching over and admoniſhing one another, the ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening the feeble minded, the viſiting and comforting the afflicted, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving one anothers wants, the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring on anothers burdens, the having the ſame care one for another, and the like. Together with theſe we may reckon the yielding and allowing to every one the liberty of ſharing in the common priviledge of enjoying
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:40113:162"/>Communion in Goſpel-Ordinances and Worſhip, ſo long as they have not made themſelves uncapable of it by drawing on themſelves deſervedly the Cenſures of the Church, nor are otherwiſe naturally uncapable of the end and uſe for which thoſe Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, or any of them were ordained, as little Children ſeem to be in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>THus much briefly touching the nature of Catholick Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: Come we now to enquire how, and by what means it may beſt be preſerved. There are two Bonds which the Scripture mentions, by which Chriſtians are bound and knit together in one Communion, the bond of <hi>Charity,</hi> and the bond of <hi>Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1, The bond of Charity: <hi>Above all theſe things put on Charity which is the bond of perfectneſs,</hi> Col. 3.14. Charity is a bond which knits and unites mens
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:40113:163"/>hearts together, and makes them <hi>one in affection,</hi> (<hi>knit together in love,</hi> as as it is expreſt <hi>Col.</hi> 2.2.) and while they be ſo, it can hardly be but that they will be <hi>one in Communion.</hi> This was that which made the Catholick Church in its beginning to be <hi>all of one heart and one ſoul,</hi> as it is ſaid the multitude of them that believed were, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.32. And that was the reaſon doubtleſs why they continued ſtedfaſtly in their Communion in the Apoſtles Doctrine and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and in breaking of bread and prayer.</p>
               <p>Charity we ſee is called the bond of perfectneſs: for the Church is in a kind of perfect ſtate in her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſo long as the Parts and Members of it are knit together in one Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by <hi>love; made perfect in one,</hi> as our Saviour expreſſeth it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.23. And the Union in Communion which is made by love, is Union in its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, nothing unites Chriſtians ſo entirely and firmly as love does. If Chriſtians love one another <hi>in the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:40113:163"/>truth, and for the truth ſake which dwelleth in them,</hi> as St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks, this Love and Union by Love will laſt; there will be no failure in the oneneſs of Communion, until there be firſt a failure in love.</p>
               <p>Charity muſt needs unite and knit Chriſtians together in one Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, becauſe it is the Principle from which the particular acts of Chriſtian Fellowſhip, fore-mentioned, do ſpring: a great part of the acts of Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, are nothing elſe but offices of brotherly love, and by theſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans take faſt hold one of another. Charity in its own nature is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicative of the good it has, and the good it can do, and by that it does attract and draw others to a nearer conjunction with thoſe in whom it dwells. Charity is the <hi>Arms</hi> of the Chriſtians <hi>inner</hi> man by which they imbrace one another, though ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>Love is of a winning nature, it gains upon others that ſtand at a diſtance: If a Principle of love be in the heart,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:40113:164"/>it will ſeaſon a mans ſpeech, and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him to <hi>ſpeak the truth in love,</hi> according to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> direction. And the truth ſpoken in love will ſooner reconcile, than the ſtrongeſt Arguments when mixt with bitterneſs of Spirit. A tongue of love is <hi>Solomons</hi> tongue of health, it will heal wounds, when another tongue does but make them. And therefore with great reaſon did St. <hi>Paul</hi> call upon the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> to do all their things with Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ſpent a whole Chapter upon them to perſuade them to it, as an effectual means to cure the diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into which they were unhappily fallen.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Charity covereth a multitude of ſins,</hi> (1 Pet. 4.8.) and by that means among other it keeps Chriſtians from flying aſunder, and dividing in their Communion, which many times takes its firſt riſe from very ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, when they meet with an evil mind that will aggravate and make the worſt of things, and ſeek out mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to make the breach wider. But
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:40113:164"/>Charity is not apt to ſpie faults, or to pick quarrels, nor to aggravate and make the worſt of things, nor to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour jealouſies or evil ſurmiſes, out of which breaches are wont to grow: but it will over-look mens weakneſs, miſtakes, and inadvertencies, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving they do not proceed from an evil mind. And if any thing be amiſs, love will take notice of all the extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating circumſtances in the caſe much rather than thoſe which tend to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate a matter. <hi>Charity thinketh not evil, is not eaſily provoked, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things;</hi> and by theſe means charitable men have hold of others, and keep them from flying out, unleſs of very bad minds and ill tempers.</p>
               <p>The truth is, Charity is that to Catholick Communion, which the Soul is to the natural body, the life and ſpirit of it that preſerves it in a healthful condition; but ſo far as Charity is wanting in Communion, ſo far that Communion is ſickly
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:40113:165"/>and languiſhing, and void of its true ſpirit and life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other Bond by which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are bound up together in one Catholick Communion, is the <hi>bond of peace,</hi> Epheſ. 4.3. <hi>Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</hi> So that we ſee Peace is the bond by which the Unity of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is kept. Now this <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the Spirit is that oneneſs of mind and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of practice which holy men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by the Spirit have taught all Chriſtians to obſerve, in reference to <hi>Faith, Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Love:</hi> that is, that they ſhould be all of one and the ſame Faith, uſe the ſame Worſhip, and have the ſame love to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which are the ſame things in which the Communion of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church from the beginning of it did conſiſt, as I have already ſhewed. When St. <hi>Paul</hi> beſeecheth the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt that they would <hi>all ſpeak the ſame thing, and that there might be no diviſions among them, but that they
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:40113:165"/>would be perfectly joyned together in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judgment,</hi> he doth not ſay in reference to what, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. But it is to be ſuppoſed that they readily underſtood his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to refer to theſe great Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Chriſtianity. The like we have in <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.1, 2. ſave that love is there particularly inſtanced in: <hi>If there be therefore any conſolation in Chriſt, if any comfort of love, if any fellowſhip of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies; fulfil ye my joy, that ye be like minded, having the ſame love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one accord, of one mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Unity of the Spirit then is the Unity of Chriſtians in thoſe things in which they have Communion, or their Unity in Communion; and this is we ſee to be kept or preſerved by the bond of peace. Now this peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth chiefly in Chriſtians avoiding differences among themſelves as much as in them lies. But if differences do ariſe, then this peace conſiſteth in ſuch gentleneſs, moderation, and calmneſs of behaviour in Chriſtians one towards
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:40113:166"/>another, as by reaſon whereof their Chriſtian Converſe is not interrupted, nor their Communion diſturbed, their differences notwithſtanding. It is true indeed, in this imperfect ſtate, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be but that there will be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of opinion among Chriſtians about leſſer things not eſſential to Communion, eſpecially concerning ſuch circumſtantial matters as are left undetermined in Scripture, except only by general rule. For conſidering that more Chriſtians are weake than thoſe that are ſtrong, and leſs ſpiritual both in point of knowledge, and in the graces of Humility, Meekneſs, and Charity, and more unmortified in ſelf-will, and ſelf-conceit, it cannot be otherwiſe but that there will be differences among Chriſtians. But yet if the greater, the wiſer and the better ſort of Chriſtians do not ſlight and deſpiſe thoſe that differ from them through weakneſs of judgment, or prejudice of education, nor violently oppoſe them, but patiently bear with them, and wiſely inſinuate to them by
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:40113:166"/>degrees thoſe things which may help them, and by condeſcenſion become all things to them for their good ſo far as innocently they can, peace may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well be preſerved among them which otherwiſe differ in many things. Not but that offences will come when the beſt men have done the beſt they can to prevent it; for this will fall out ſo long as there are thoſe among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians whoſe Luſts and Paſſions are unmortified. But I am ſhewing how the Unity of the Spirit may be kept in the bond of peace among them that differ in mind and opinion about circumſtantial matters, and that they may converſe very lovingly together, where unmortified Luſts and Paſſions do not prevail, notwithſtanding ſuch difference. The wiſe and good carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of good men towards thoſe that differ, will have a great influence upon them, if not preſently to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them in opinion, yet to charm them into a peaceable demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, if they be not men of ill tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:40113:167"/>
               <p>God himſelf makes allowances unto men that differ conſcienciouſly about leſſer things, and not out of affectation, though they err in judgment, ſo long as their error proceeds not from a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt will or pride of mind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and good men ſo far as they are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of a divine nature, will do ſo too. And ſuch differences are very conſiſtent with Catholick Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in peace and love. So that it is not ſo much mens differing in opinion about circumſtantial matters in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that breaks Peace, deſtroys Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and diſturbs the Communion of the Church, but mens unruly Luſts and Paſſions of pride, envy, and ill will, which take the advantage thence to vent themſelves againſt one another in irregular practices. <hi>From whence come wars and brawlings among you? Come they not hence, even of your luſts that war in your members?</hi> Jam. 4.1.</p>
               <p>Tho Chriſtians then may differ in opinion in ſome leſſer things, yet ſo long as they agree in the ſubſtance of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:40113:167"/>Faith and Worſhip; and ſo long as they manage themſelves in their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences ſo as that peace is not broken by any irregular or troubleſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, their Communion in Faith, Worſhip, and Fellowſhip, or mutual love, cannot ſuffer much by ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences. For Peace and Charity ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port each other, and propagate each other. And the Apoſtle does very well therefore couple them together in his Exhortation, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.14, 15. <hi>Above all theſe things put on Charity, which is the bond of perfectneſs; and let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which ye are called in one body.</hi> The Peace here meant, to which Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are called by being united in one body, is peaceable living one with another.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Beſides the bond of Charity, and the bond of Peace, there is a third thing very neceſſary to the Unity and peaceable Communion in the Church, and that is <hi>prudent and moderate Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> The <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>purity</hi> of the Church are two great ends of the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:40113:168"/>Government in it, both which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce very much to the comfortable Communion of the Church, and to the Chriſtians Unanimity in it. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to which, <hi>Moderation</hi> is very neceſſary in reſpect of the external manner and circumſtances of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; as namely, that the terms of Communion therein be made as eaſie as will well conſiſt with publick edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and comely order. For when they are ſo, men will have no tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable pretenſe upon account of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to refuſe Communion with the Church therein. But otherwiſe ſome out of ſcruple of Conſcience and others from a worſe Principle, will be apt to take occaſion to diſturb the peace of the Church with diſputes, and by deſerting the Communion of it.</p>
               <p>And then moderation and prudence are neceſſary to the ſame end in the exerciſe of Diſcipline in the Church, by making a difference in correcting open and notorious ſcandals, and leſſer diſorders. For elſe if both be
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:40113:168"/>puniſhed alike when they are not alike criminal; or if leſſer diſorders ſhall be ſtrictly looked after, and ſeverely puniſhed, and greater connived at, it will tend to leſſen the Government in mens reverence and eſteem, and ſo weaken the fenſe of the Churches peace, and render Communion with her leſs deſirable by ſuch as will take themſelves to be unequally dealt with by her.</p>
               <p>But as good Government in the Church is neceſſary to its Peace, and to Unity in its Communion, ſo is obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to ſuch Government, without which Government loſeth its end.</p>
               <p>But when the Government and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of it is equal and as eaſie as will conſiſt with the due ends of it, then if yet for all that men will be troubleſom and diſobedient under it, they will be left without excuſe in the eyes of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber men, if fitting courſe be taken to reſtrain them from diſturbing the peace of the Church; for otherwiſe if this be not granted, Government in the Church would ſignifie little.</p>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:40113:169"/>
               <p>THus much concerning our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry touching the nature of Catholick Communion, and the means of preſerving it. But before I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to an Inquiry into the nature of Schiſm. I think it not amiſs to enquire for what reaſon the Unity of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Communion is neceſſary, and why we ſhould endeavour that as much as may be it ſhould be kept en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and all of a piece, and without Fracture. And the only reaſon which I ſhall inſiſt on is this; becauſe its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch, and ſo kept and maintained, tends greatly to the growth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the Church both in reſpect of the number of its Members, and bigneſs of its Body, and alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of its healthful ſtate, and its growing up to a greater ſtature in all virtue and goodneſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It tends to the increaſe of the body of Chriſtians in the number of its Members. For next to the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:40113:169"/>operations of the Holy Ghoſt in the Apoſtles and Primitive Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, the peaceable and charitable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour among Chriſtians, and good agreement among themſelves if it were generally found in them, would attract and draw men to the liking and love of the Religion which they profeſs, for the ſake of the lovely effects it produceth in them. Men can hardly think otherwiſe than well of that Religion by which they find men are made more peaceable and loving, and more ready to all good offices to one another, and to all men than others are, or than they themſelves were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they engaged heartily and ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in it.</p>
               <p>And that the concord and good agreement of all Chriſtians in one Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion has ſo happy a tendency, as I have ſaid, to draw others to the belief &amp; love of that ſame Religion, appears by the reaſon why, and for which our bleſſed Saviour ſo earneſtly deſired and prayed for the Union and Agreement of all Chriſtians
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:40113:170"/>in the things their Religien taught them, to wit, becauſe the world would thereby be brought to believe that he the Author of it, had been ſent of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.20, 21. <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſhall believe on me through their word; that they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee; that they alſo may be one in us, that the world may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> And its moſt apparent that the contrary to this has had its contrary effect. For where have any ſuch numerous additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Catholick Church been found from among the Pagan world, ſince the great diviſions which have riſen and been kept on foot in the Chriſtian world, as thoſe which were made for ſome hundreds of years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Primitive times while Catholick Communion was preſerved in the Church without any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable interruption? Nay, have not the unreaſonable diviſions and fierce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions which have broken out in the Reformed Churches ſince the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:40113:170"/>and in our own nation eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, been a temptation to many to turn Atheiſts or Scepticks?</p>
               <p>The holy Scriptures in many places ſeem to foretel a more general flowing of the Nations of the world into the Church, than ever yet has been accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed: But we cannot reaſonably expect this ſhould be brought to paſs by means of the Chriſtian Churches in being, until by humility, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, and charity, and good agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among themſelves, and other virtues, they make a better repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the excellency of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which they profeſs, than they do at this day. When God Almighty <hi>turns to the people a pure Language,</hi> then it may be expected they will <hi>call upon him, and ſerve him with one conſent,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.9, Not while they treat one another with <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure</hi> and corrupt Language which ſmels of wrath and diſdain, of envy, ſpight, and contempt; Not while by words they do all they can to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace one another, but by <hi>ſpeaking
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:40113:171"/>the truth in love,</hi> and with <hi>meekneſs of wiſdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The good agreement of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in one Catholick Communion, tends greatly to the increaſe of the Church in reſpect of its ſpiritual health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtate, and its growing up to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtature in all virtue and goodneſs. For where peace and good agreement is in the ſeveral offices of Chriſtian Brotherhood, there love is, which is the bond of perfectneſs which holds them faſt together. And love is a <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical</hi> grace, out of which other graces grow, in ſo much that love is made the Summary of all Chriſtian duties towards one another: <hi>Love</hi> is ſaid to <hi>be the fulfilling of the Law,</hi> Rom. 13.8.10. <hi>Charity edifieth,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.1. It tends to edifie and build up the ſubject in which it dwels, and to make him more like God who is love; and it tends to edifie the object on which it is ſet, and on which it exerciſeth it ſelf; it tends to build up both the one and the other in grace and goodneſs.</p>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:40113:171"/>
               <p>And there is this further reaſon why a peaceable agreement in one Catholick Communion tends to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Church in her ſpiritual riches, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the holy Spirit of God delights to dwell where peace and love dwell, and there to diſpence and communicate his treaſures by which the ſouls of men are enriched; but without his ſupplies, influences, and operations, there is no thriving in grace and real goodneſs. <hi>He that dwels in love, God dwels in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.16. And where God takes up his ſpecial reſidence, he will adorn thoſe living Temples with plenty of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ornaments, and thoſe ſhall be ſure to be made partakers of his beſt ſort of gifts, ſuch as the world cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. <hi>Be of one mind, live in peace, and the God of love and peace ſhall be with you,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.11. While the Catholick Church is of one mind in the great things of Chriſtian Religion, and being ſo, do live in peace, and not unpeaceably contend, fall out and divide about leſſer things,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:40113:172"/>ſuch as for which God perhaps doth neither eſteem or diſeſteem men, he who is the God of love and peace will be with them to bleſs them with his preſence, with ſpiritual bleſſings eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially. And as the preſence of the ſoul in the body enlivens it with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural life, by virtue whereof the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Members perform their ſeveral fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions proper to each of them reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, even ſo the preſence of the holy Spirit in the body of Chriſt the Church does animate it with ſpiritual life, and does ſo influence and actuate the ſeveral Members of it, as that by virtue thereof they all perform their ſeveral Chriſtian offices proper to each for the common good of the whole.</p>
               <p>But then this vital power of acting ſpiritually, is conveyed by the Spirit to each of the Members <hi>as they are in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> and <hi>communion with the whole,</hi> and ſo as one Member is made a Channel of this conveyance to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and each enabled to contribute its part to the common good of the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:40113:172"/>whole. Thus <hi>Col.</hi> 2.19. where St. <hi>Paul,</hi> mentioning the Head of the Church, ſaith, <hi>from which all the body by joynts and bonds having nouriſhment miniſtred and knit together, increaſeth with the increaſe of God.</hi> This ſpiritual nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of the body, flows from Chriſt the Head we ſee, as having obtained it by his Mediation; but then it is the great Office-work of the holy Spirit to apply the beneſits ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Chriſt, to the ſeveral mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his body by working and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing grace and comfort in them. <hi>He ſhall glorifie me, for he ſhall receive of mine, and ſhew it unto you,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, ſpeaking of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.14. And this conveyance of nouriſhment from the Head to the Members by the Holy Spirit, is made by the union of the parts as knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by joynts and bands, by which Union one member is made a Channel of conveyance of nouriſhment to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and in this way the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy increaſeth with the increaſe of God. This being ſo, a diſunion of the parts
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:40113:173"/>or members muſt needs obſtruct this ſpiritual nouriſhment, and hinder the growth of the body. To the ſame effect is that parallel place, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.15, 16. <hi>Speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Chriſt: from whom the whole body fitly joyned together, and compacted by that which every joynt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth, according to the effectual working of the meaſure of every part, maketh increaſe of the body, unto the edifying of it ſelf in love.</hi> This increaſe of the body to the edifying it ſelf in love, is made we ſee both by the parts of the body being joyned together, and alſo by that which every joynt ſupplyeth being ſo compacted.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee how the increaſe of the Church in ſpiritual ſtrength de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon Gods ſpecial preſence and aſſiſtance, and how the enjoyment of that preſence depends upon the peaceable agreement and mutual love of the parts of which the Church doth conſiſt. And if ſo, then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceableneſs, diſcord and ſtrife, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:40113:173"/>and dividing into Parties in the Church, muſt neceſſarily tend to deprive her of that ſpecial preſence and divine aſſiſtance of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, without which Chriſtians cannot thrive and increaſe in true goodneſs, and for want of which they will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther decline and go backward. Tho the God of peace and of love will be with his People while they are ſo of one mind in the Eſſentials of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, as upon that account to live in peace and Chriſtian Communion one with another, notwithſtanding their differing in ſome leſſer things, which will always be found in the beſt eſtate of the Church which can be expected here on earth; yet there is no reaſon to expect he will be ſo with them when they do not ſo live in peace, tho they ſhould otherwiſe be of one mind in the fundamental Doctrines of Chriſtianity, and all the ſubſtantial parts of Worſhip.</p>
               <p>The holy Spirit may indeed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe gifts of Knowledge, and Ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance, and the like, which are
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:40113:174"/>common to bad men as well as good; ſuch as theſe he may beſtow upon Chriſtians even while they are in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and unpeaceable diviſion: But as for thoſe <hi>fruits of the Spirit</hi> which conſtitute men truly good, ſuch as <hi>love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, goodneſs, and meekneſs,</hi> (Gal. 5.22.) the having of theſe and mens being of an unpeaceable temper, and in a ſtate of diſcord and diviſion, are I fear inconſiſtent; for theſe are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary one to another. Tho St. <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledged thoſe of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> to be <hi>enriched with all utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and all knowledge,</hi> Chap. 1, 5. yet in <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.1. he tells them that he <hi>could not ſpeak unto them as unto ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, but as unto carnal, even as to babes in Chriſt;</hi> and for this reaſon, as it follows in <hi>ver.</hi> 3. becauſe there <hi>was among them envying, ſtrife, and diviſion. Ye are yet carnal,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there is among you envying, and ſtrife, and diviſions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men;</hi> that is, as other men which were no Chriſtians. They
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:40113:174"/>might indeed know and believe, and talk otherwiſe and better than thoſe that were out of the Church, but their walking and living was but as theirs, while envying, ſtrife, and diviſion was found with them. For theſe are of thoſe <hi>works of the fleſh</hi> of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>that thoſe which do ſuch things, ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> Gal. 5.20, 21.</p>
               <p>And if Chriſtians would but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine and judge of themſelves by theſe Scripture meaſures, it would make them on all hands, one ſide as well as another, to be as much afraid to do any thing to diſturb the peace of the Church, or to be guilty of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying, ſtrife, and diviſion in it, as they would be to find themſelves but in a carnal ſtate, and of being ſhut out of the Kingdom of heaven.</p>
               <p>And as for thoſe who are guilty of theſe things in theſe ſad times, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in envying ſtrife and diviſion do abound, it is hugely neceſſary that as they love their own ſouls, they would without delay repent, and get out of
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:40113:175"/>ſuch a ſtate, and not flatter and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves with an opinion of their good and ſafe condition upon account of their being otherwiſe Orthodox and Religious, ſo long as they indulge themſelves in ſuch a ſtate.</p>

               <head>QUERY XIV. <hi>What is the nature of Schiſm?</hi>
               </head>
               <p>From what hath been diſcourſed touching the nature of Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and the means of preſerving it, we may be able to make a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the nature of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> what it is, and who are guilty of it. For if Catholick Communion ſtands in the Unity of the Spirit, or Chriſtians Unity in their Communion in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Faith in things neceſſary to Salvation, and in the ſubſtance of Worſhip; and in their fellowſhip or mutual love, as I have ſhew'd it
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:40113:175"/>does; then their being <hi>divided</hi> in theſe, or any one of theſe, or in any leſſer things, if the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion be thereby deſtroyed, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly is <hi>Schiſm.</hi> When any thing which before was but one, comes to be divided, it ceaſeth to be one any longer, unleſs there be a re-union; and thus it is in reference to Church Communion.</p>
               <p>Altho Chriſtians do agree in the Chriſtian Faith, and in the ſubſtance of Worſhip alſo, yet if upon account of any leſſer things they be ſo divided as that Chriſtian Fellowſhip or Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love be thereby deſtroyed, their <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of Communion is thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed alſo. I do not ſay that all their Communion in thoſe things wherein they are agreed is deſtroyed by uncharitable diviſion, but this I ſay that the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of their Communion is thereby deſtroyed. For Brotherly love is an eſſential part of Cotholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, ſo that if that be deſtroyed by any diviſion, tho but about leſſer matters, the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the Communion
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:40113:176"/>is deſtroyed, and the guilt of Schiſm contracted, yea, and their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion it ſelf in Faith and Worſhip, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are agreed, is greatly damni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied alſo.</p>
               <p>For their Communion in Faith and Worſhip is rendred unacceptable to God, and unprofitable to themſelves for want of Communion in Brotherly love: <hi>though I had all Faith and have not Charity, I am nothing.</hi> And for Worſhip: <hi>If thou bringeſt thy gift to the Altar, and remembereſt that thy Brother hath ought againſt thee; leave there thy gift before the Altar, and go thy way, firſt be reconciled to thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then come and offer thy gift;</hi> Shewing how little God regardeth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votional Communion in Worſhip when void of true Charity.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Schiſm</hi> we enquire after then, lies in <hi>diviſion in the Church,</hi> as that is oppoſite to, and deſtructive of Chriſtian <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> in <hi>Faith,</hi> or in <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> or in <hi>Love,</hi> And all Church di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion tends more or leſs to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Chriſtian Unity in theſe
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:40113:176"/>in whole or in part. That it lies in <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion,</hi> appears in that it receives its name from that; for the word <hi>Schiſm</hi> ſignifies <hi>diviſion</hi> or a rent. And the Tranſlators of our Engliſh Bible, when they have put the word <hi>diviſion</hi> in the line reading, they have put <hi>Schiſm</hi> in the Margin, 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 10.10. and 11.18. and when <hi>Schiſm</hi> in the line, <hi>diviſion</hi> in the Margin. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.25. and this they have done to explain the one by the other.</p>
               <p>Since then Schiſm conſiſts in Church diviſion, it follows, that by how much the greater the diviſion is at any time, by ſo much the greater is the Schiſm; and the leſs the one is, the leſs is the other alſo. We muſt therefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh of Schiſm. There are ſeveral ſorts or degrees of Diviſion, and ſo of Schiſm, which are ſometimes found among Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>I. A <hi>different perſuaſion</hi> in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans touching ſome things <hi>indifferent</hi> in their own nature, ſome holding them unlawful, others lawful, ſome accounting them neceſſary, when
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:40113:177"/>others are otherwiſe perſuaded. This difference fell out between the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Jews and the believing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles touching ſome meats, the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of days, and the uſe of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion. And a difference much like to this, in ſome reſpects, has fallen our among ſome Chriſtians in our days, and in our Nation. Now a <hi>difference</hi> of this nature, tho it be in ſome ſort a <hi>diviſion,</hi> yet it is capable of being ſo managed, as that the effects of ſinful Schiſm ſhall ſcarcely at all follow upon it. As thus;</p>
               <p>Firſt, if thoſe who are ſcrupulous, and yet under a miſtake, ſhall be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and humble in their diſſenting, and deſirous to be as little troubleſom and offenſive to their Brethren from whom they differ as poſſibly they can, and as tender of diſturbing the peace of the Church as their caſe will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and ready to hear and imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to conſider any thing offered by their brethren to remove their ſcruples, and reconcile them in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:40113:177"/>
               <p>Secondly, if they be not averſe to comply with their Brethren in all things <hi>ſo far as they can,</hi> and to hold Communion with them ſo far as they have <hi>attained</hi> and are agreed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apoſtles Exhortation in that caſe, when he ſays, <hi>Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the ſame rule, let us mind the ſame thing,</hi> Phil. 3.16. For theſe words were uſed in reference to thoſe Chriſtians mentioned in the Verſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of whom he had ſaid, <hi>If in any thing ye be otherwiſe minded, God ſhall reveal even this unto you.</hi> And indeed this compliance is neceſſary in all like caſes to prevent Schiſm, upon a double account.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Otherwiſe, ſuch <hi>do not what they can</hi> to preſerve Peace, and prevent Schiſm, and ſo muſt be guilty of it if it follow for want of ſuch compliance. That to do thus is their undoubted duty, is clear from that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.18. <hi>If it be poſſible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men;</hi> how much more with fellow
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:40113:178"/>Chriſtians. If Chriſtian compliance than be the way to live peaceably with Chriſtian Brethren then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that if they do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <hi>as much as in them lies,</hi> and as far as they can when the preſerving of peace requires it, they do not what they ought to do, and if Schiſm or a breach of peace follows, they muſt needs be acceſſary to it, and guilty of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe if they do not comply ſo far as they can,, they give occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuſpicion that their non-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance in that wherein their differing from their Brethren profeſſedly lies, proceeds not ſo much from ſcruple of conſcience as from ſome worſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſuch as, humour ſelf will, a ſpirit of oppoſition and contradiction, or a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal prejudice againſt the men from whom they differ, or the like. For it will be thought that if Conſcience to God were the only reaſon why they differ with their Brethren in any thing; that then Conſcience would engage them to go along with their
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:40113:178"/>Brethren in that wherein they do not differ, and to be tender and ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of making the difference or breach between them wider than needs muſt, and of multiplying occaſion of offence cauſeleſly. Men cannot be confident when they ſee ſuch men are not ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Conſcience in the one, that they are ſo in the other, but will be apt to ſuſpect that their differing proceeds chiefly from ſome worſe cauſe, tho the parties themſelves perhaps are not aware of it, but think it proceeds from the goodneſs of their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when there is no ſuch matter. And when this occaſion of ſuſpicion is given by not complying in what they can, the natural effect of it will be to weaken mens eſteem of them, and affection to them, and to prepare the way to farther difference. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a compliance, as far as poſſibly they can, would maintain a good opinion of them in mens minds, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them fair quarter from them that differ from them, prevent the differenee from growing up into a
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:40113:179"/>direct Schiſm, and prepare the way to reconciliation.</p>
               <p>For when it does indeed appear by complying as far as they can, and by other truly Chriſtian behaviour of perſons that through error of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment differ from their Brethren in other things, that that difference proceeds purely from Conſcience tho erronious, and not from a worſe Principle, their caſe is truly <hi>pitiable,</hi> and calls for tenderneſs towards them from them that differ from them; and to treat them accordingly, is certainly the way to gain upon them, and to make them the more capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving information and ſatisfaction in their ſcruples. Whereas when they are otherwiſe treated with ſeverity, it tends to ſpoil their good temper, and to exaſperate them, and to make them out of diſguſt to them who have ſo dealt with them, to unite into Parties, and make head againſt them, to the imbroiling the Church in grievous Schiſm.</p>
               <pb n="309" facs="tcp:40113:179"/>
               <p n="2">2. There is another and worſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion or Schiſm than meer difference in judgment and practice in ſome leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer things, and that diviſion lies more in Chriſtians unchriſtian managing their differences than in the difference that is in their opinion and practice when it is but about ſome things wherein the good or hurt of men would be little concerned, if they could be ſeparated from their effects. And this diviſion lies in the <hi>immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> manner of contending for that wherein Chriſtians differ. As thus; when they do not content themſelves with offering their arguments fairly and peaceably for that wherein they differ, but fall out with their Brethren for not ſubmitting to, but oppoſing them both in their arguments and practice, as when they ſet them at naught, and cenſure them as inſincere, as not truly lovers of truth, but that they are byaſſed by ſome undue intereſt, of honour, reputation, or gain, or humour, or ſelf-will, and that theſe prevail with them more than
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:40113:180"/>truth. Now ſuch things as theſe, are of a provoking nature, and lay a temptation upon their Brethrens Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and tend directly to alienate affections, and miniſter to unpeace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able contendings, and are a direct breach of peace. Tho men have truth on their ſide, yet they may be Schiſmatical in labouring to propagate, or to defend that truth, when they go farther in doing ſo than <hi>ſpeaking the truth in love,</hi> I mean in way of Controverſie. Tho thoſe that differ from them may poſſibly be moved with undue motives to oppoſe them, and the reaſons for what they hold; yet becauſe whether they be ſo or no, is a matter of which they are not competent Judges, it lying out of their reach, and belonging only to the Judgment of God, who only is the ſearcher of hearts, therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may fear or ſuſpect, yet they ſhould forbear either to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce or inſinuate any ſuch hard things againſt their Brethren, by which they <hi>become Judges of evil
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:40113:180"/>thoughts.</hi> Which if they do not, they ſtir up ſtrife, and violate peace by cauſing unquietneſs and diſorder in the Church, and deſtroy Charity, weaken, yea, wound the very Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Churches Communion, which without doubt is Schiſm, tho it ſhould never proceed to actual ſeparation.</p>
               <p>This mingling of mens Paſſions and unchriſtian Cenſures and inſinuations with their Arguments, hinders the due operation of their Arguments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Antagoniſts minds, tho they ſhould have truth on their ſide; <hi>For the wrath of man worketh not the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God,</hi> but hinders it, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.20. Whereas tho men do differ, yet ſo long as they propoſe and reply one to another no otherwiſe than as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing both ſides to be only in the ſearch of truth, they may live loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and peaceably together, and enjoy Edifying and comfortable Communion one with onother, their difference in Judgment notwithſtanding.</p>
               <pb n="312" facs="tcp:40113:181"/>
               <p n="3">3. There is a diviſion, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a Schiſm in the Church of a higher nature than the former, and that is when the perſons that divide, or cauſe diviſion in the Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily gather into a <hi>Party,</hi> and do after a ſort unite and combine themſelves together, the more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly and avowedly to maintain and carry on the Cauſe they have eſpouſed in oppoſition to their Brethren, and induſtriouſly labour to increaſe their number as hoping thereby in time to be able to bring their oppoſites to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to them, and to give up their Cauſe. Now if the thing or things they after this manner contend for, ſhould be unprofitable for the Church in caſe they ſhould obtain, or of ſo little uſe or benefit, as that it could never reaſonably be expected that it ſhould countervail the hurt that is or will be done to the Church, to the Communion of the Church, to the Cauſe of Religion in the world, and to the Souls of men in general, by being obtained in ſuch a way, it would
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:40113:181"/>be a moſt grievous Schiſm thus to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide and imbroil the Church upon ſo mean an account.</p>
               <p>A Diviſion or Schiſm of this nature is termed <hi>Faction,</hi> which is a ſiding or making of Parties in the Church. And of this nature in ſome ſort was the Schiſm in the Church of <hi>Corinth:</hi> For their Diviſions were factious Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, for they proceeded to making of Parties. Their Crime in this, charged upon them by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> is termed <hi>Diviſions</hi> in our Bibles, but the word is <hi>Faction</hi> in the Margin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. And part of the works of the fleſh rendred <hi>Seditions</hi> in our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, is <hi>Diviſions</hi> or <hi>Factions</hi> in the Margin, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.20. This ſort of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion which is accompanied with Faction, or making of Parties, is more than is found in ſome Diviſions which yet are ſinful.</p>
               <p>Now when a Schiſm grows up to this height, to a combined ſtrength, it is much worſe than while it was acted only by a few apart, and in a more private way, and leſs taken
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:40113:182"/>notice of; becauſe then there is more of contempt in it, and more are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by it, and the peace of the Community more diſturbed; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe uſually by endeavours of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the Party, much more evil is perpetrated by ſlanders, naughty inſinuations and ſuggeſtions againſt thoſe they divide from, and combine againſt, than was found in the nature of the diviſion at firſt, or in the nature of the error on which the diviſion firſt began.</p>
               <p>This factious diviſion is likewiſe aggravated further when it partakes of the nature of <hi>Sedition:</hi> And we ſee in the fore-cited place, <hi>(Gal. 5.)</hi> the ſame word ſignifies <hi>Diviſion, Faction,</hi> and <hi>Sedition.</hi> Now <hi>Sedition,</hi> I conceive, is a diviſion accompanied with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of men againſt the <hi>Government</hi> either of Church or State under which the Providence of God hath ſet them: It is their acting things contrary to that Government, farther than the neceſſity of not ſinning againſt God does oblige them, to the diſturbing
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:40113:182"/>of the publick peace thereby: or it may be ſo perhaps by ſeeking to alter any thing amiſs or inconvenient in the Government, in an undue way; that is, by acting out of their ſphere, or the place or rank in which the providence of God hath ſet them; their going beyond their bounds in it, or their doing more to accompliſh it, than the Law or Government under which they are, allows them. For otherwiſe it is not ſeditious (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) for men to endeavour to get any thing amiſs in the Government to be altered in a regular way; that is, in ſuch a way as the Government or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Conſtitution allows.</p>
               <p>I need not ſay how much the two bonds, the one of Peace, the other of Charity, is broken by this ſort of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion which is accompanied either with Faction or Sedition, nor how great the Schiſm is that is made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: But this is certain that a Diviſion of this kind cannot be without much <hi>envying and ſtrife;</hi> and where theſe are, <hi>there is confuſion, and every
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:40113:183"/>evil work,</hi> as St. <hi>James</hi> hath told us, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.16.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another ſort of diviſion in the Church, is that which is made by an <hi>unjuſt Separation</hi> of one part of the Catholick Church from another in the buſineſs of their Communion in their ſolemn Worſhip: And this is a diviſion of a very high nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, eſpecially when it is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the third ſort of Diviſion before inſiſted on. For if ſuch a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion be unjuſtly made, it is point blank contrary to the Unity of the Spirit; that is, contrary to the Unity of Communion among Chriſtians which was taught and practiſed by men inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Spirit, in reference both to ſolemn Worſhip, and Chriſtian Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as has been formerly explained. By ſuch a Diviſion the Churches peace is broken with a high hand, great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence being thereby taken at others, and cauſe of offence given to them, and a wide gap opened for debate, ſtrife, contention, and confuſion to enter in, to a dreadful deſtruction of Charity,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:40113:183"/>the ſpirit and life of Chriſtianity, without which Faith it ſelf is dead, and all other religious performances little available.</p>
               <p>It concerns us greatly therefore, and ſome men more eſpecially, very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to inquire, how far the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Separations that do abound in our days, and in this Nation, are unjuſtly or juſtly made. To do which I do not know a more compendious way than to enquire into the nature of our National Conſtitution about Gods publick Worſhip, and the power of giving being to it, and how far we are obliged to obſerve it.</p>
               <p>That ſuch National Conſtitutions as have been made in ſeveral Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for reformation from Popery, and for the eſtabliſhing of the Reformed Religion and Worſhip in the room of it, ſince the beginning of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, has been ſo far approved of by God, as that he does reckon and eſteem thoſe Nations his Kingdoms upon that account, I have found, as I conceive, in our twelfth Inquiry.
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:40113:184"/>Which with what elſe is there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and argued for the uſefulneſs of ſuch National Conſtitutions, I take to be ground ſufficient to authorize a National authority in ſuch an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</p>
               <p>Now when ever the forming of ſuch National Conſtitution is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by them to whom it does be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, they muſt needs find, that tho the Eſſentials and ſubſtance of all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip is expreſly and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſet down in Scripture, yet there are ſeveral Circumſtances and Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of Worſhip which pertain to the external adminiſtration of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which are not otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in Scripture than by general Rules; as that <hi>Edification, Order, and Decency</hi> be always obſerved in the choice of ſuch things as are not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly determined and ſet down in Scripture. Such are thoſe I inſtanced in in another of our Inquiries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Prayer: tho all the ſubſtantial parts of it are determined in Scripture, yet we are no where limited to pray
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:40113:184"/>with a ſet Form, nor without one, to uſe or not to uſe Book-prayer, to kneel or to ſtand in Praying, nor directed whether in the Publick Worſhip there ſhall be ſeveral diſtinct and ſhort Prayers uſed for ſeveral things, or whether all Prayer, matter fit for a publick Aſſembly, ſhall be compriſed in one or more longer Prayers. And the like may be ſaid touching ſeveral external Circumſtances that are to be uſed in all other parts of Publick Worſhip.</p>
               <p>This being the caſe, it will neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily fall under the conſideration of thoſe who are imployed in the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a publick Conſtitution for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which of theſe will tend moſt to the Peace, Unity, and Ediſication of the Church, and to Decency and Order; whether to leave all aſide termined Circumſtances of Worſhip to every ones choice, who are to adminiſter the holy things, or in theſe things to chuſe for them, and to determine by an Eccleſiaſtical Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution what ſhall be obſerved.</p>
               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:40113:185"/>
               <p>Suppoſe we then that upon ſerious conſideration and conſultation they come to be fully perſuaded in their own minds, that to leave all, both Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and People, to their own choice in ſuch undetermined Circumſtances in Gods Publick Worſhip, would tend to great Diviſion, Diſorder, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, as it did in the late times of general Liberty, and that then we ſhould have one oppoſing another in their different ways, and making of Parties one againſt another, to endleſs branglements, and to the eating out the heart and life of true Religion: And ſuppoſe alſo that upon ſuch conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations as theſe they come to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to determine all undetermined Circumſtances of Publick Worſhip by the uſe of a Liturgy, except only what is to be performed in the Pulpit, as that which tends moſt in their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to Peace, Unity, Edification, Order, and Decency.</p>
               <p>And when they have gone thus far in general, they will neceſſarily be led to proceed in the next place to
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:40113:185"/>the choice of particular Circumſtances of adminiſtration of the ſeveral parts of Publick Worſhip. In which it is to be preſumed they govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves according to the beſt of their underſtanding by thoſe general Rules which direct all things to be done for Edification, Order, and Decency,</p>
               <p>And when they have done ſo, and brought things to the beſt iſſue they could, yet conſidering that all men, and the beſt of men are fallible, it is not unlikely but that they may be miſtaken in ſome things, and that ſuch and ſuch a Circumſtance or Mode of adminiſtration of Worſhip would have better and more fully agreed with the general Rules, than thoſe they have made choice of. But yet if their fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and and miſtakes therein do not extend to the corrupting of Gods Worſhip in the Eſſence or ſubſtance of it, but only to the ordering of ſome <hi>leſs uſeful</hi> Circumſtances to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the external manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of that Worſhip, there will be no juſt cauſe of ſeparating from
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:40113:186"/>Communion in it upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>For thoſe who <hi>ſeparate</hi> from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in the Worſhip which is every Lords day performed in our Parochial Aſſemblies according to our Liturgy, are obliged to prove one of theſe two things againſt it, if they would juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their ſeparation from it. Either firſt, that the Worſhip is <hi>corrupt in the Eſſence</hi> or ſubſtance of it; or ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the faults or defects in the <hi>External manner</hi> of performance of it are ſuch as do fall ſhort of, and <hi>defeat the end</hi> for which an external way and manner of performing Publick Worſhip ſhould ſerve and is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
               <p>If they would prove ſuch Worſhip corrupt in the Eſſence or ſubſtance of it, they muſt prove that it is ſo either in the object of Worſhip, or in the ſubject matter of it, for in thoſe two the Eſſence or ſubſtance of Worſhip doth conſiſt. To prove it corrupt in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the object of Worſhip, they muſt prove that the Worſhip is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:40113:186"/>to ſome Creature as well as to the only true God, or by ſome Mediator other than Chriſt Jeſus. But this they will not pretend to do.</p>
               <p>If they would prove it corrupt in reſpect of the ſubject matter of it, they muſt prove that the Prayers which are made, or the matters for which Praiſe is given to Almighty God, are not Prayer matter, or Thankſgiving mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or that ſome other part of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is uſed as of Divine Inſtitution which is not ſuch. But now none of theſe things can be proved againſt the Liturgy. For no other things are therein prayed for, or thanks given to God for, but ſuch as the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> themſelves do, may or ought to pray for or praiſe God for, nor any thing elſe obſerved as an Ordinance of God, but what they themſelves do own to be of Divine Inſtitution, ſuch as Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and the Lords Supper. So that the whole of the Worſhip <hi>is pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of it.</p>
               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:40113:187"/>
               <p n="2">2. If then they will prove any thing to purpoſe, they muſt prove that the faults and defects in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal manner of performing the ſaid Worſhip, are ſuch as cauſe it to fall ſhort of, and do defeat the end and uſe for which an external adminiſtration of Publick Worſhip ſerves and is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
               <p>Now the end and uſe of the beſt external Mode of Worſhip, is <hi>edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> that is, it ſerves to convey the object and ſubject matter of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to the mind of the Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, to the end they may be ſutably affected.</p>
               <p>And this end of Worſhip is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated when the Worſhip is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Language which the People do not underſtand, or in ſuch words and phraſes as are inſignificant of, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſutable to the parts of Worſhip to which they are applied. But neither of theſe things can be charged upon the Worſhip performed according to the Liturgy. For the Worſhip is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in a Language underſtood by
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:40113:187"/>all the People, and in words and phraſes competently ſignificant and expreſſive of, and ſutable to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſubject matter of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in its ſeveral parts, and ſo is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the general Rule for admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Publick Worſhip, which the Apoſtle terms to be <hi>uttering by the tongue, words eaſie to be underſtood,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. By it the minds of men may be guided and conducted from one part of Worſhip to another, and be affected according to the different nature of the ſeveral parts of which the whole Worſhip doth conſiſt; which is the proper end and uſe of an external Form of adminiſtration of Publick Worſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But perhaps it will be ſaid, that the Worſhip performed according to the Liturgy does not ſo adequate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fully agree with the rule and end of the external adminiſtration of Worſhip in ſome reſpects, as it might have been made to do, or as ſome other does.</p>
               <pb n="326" facs="tcp:40113:188"/>
               <p>To which I anſwer, That the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is not whether the external manner of Worſhip according to the Liturgy be the beſt or no in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; But ſuppoſe it ſhould not, and ſuppoſe that ſome external Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ordered by it ſhould be, or make it to be leſs uſeful than it might have been, or than ſome others are; yet ſo long as they do but make it <hi>leſs uſeful</hi> to the <hi>end</hi> for which it ſerves, but do not <hi>defeat it,</hi> nor are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of it, nor of the Worſhip it ſelf, but that it remains competently uſeful to its proper end, tho com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively but in an inferiour degree. Suppoſe, I ſay, that all this ſhould be granted for Argument ſake, and we ſhould proceed with them upon their own terms, yet this would be no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe of refuſing Communion with the Church in the Ordinances of God thus adminiſtred.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For firſt, if it were, it could ſcarcely be lawful to hold Communion with any particular Church in the whole world: becauſe it is not likely
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:40113:188"/>but that more or leſs of ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Worſhip as are leſs uſeful, are uſed in all Churches in the World. For conſidering the fallibility of all men, and their knowing but in part at beſt, I think it would be no breach of Charity to ſuppoſe, that there is no Church Conſtitution for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in all the world, nor perhaps any one way of external adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of holy things humanely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, but what is accompanied with Circumſtantial defects more or leſs, ſuch, I mean, as are leſs uſeful than others that might be made uſe of, were it not for mens imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that have the making or managing of them. So that the Notion or Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that Circumſtantial defects in the external manner of Worſhip is a juſt ground of ſeparation from it, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of Catholick Communion it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. None account themſelves guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of or defiled by the defects that are in the manner of a Miniſters praying in the Pulpit, ſo long as the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:40113:189"/>matter is good: and there is the ſame reaſon in reference to Circumſtantial defects in Prayers made by the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. We can hardly ſay that any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayer is ſo free from all defects, but either in reſpect of the Method, or manner of expreſſing the matter, it might poſſibly be better done than uſually it is done even by good men. And therefore it is a very unreaſonable thing to make Circumſtantial defects in the manner of praying, a ground of ſeparation from Communion in Prayer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If it were lawful to ſeparate from Communion in Worſhip, only becauſe leſs uſefully adminiſtred; then tho there ſhould be no Liturgy in the caſe, yet where one Miniſter does but excel another in his Miniſtration, it would be lawful to ſeparate from that Congregation where the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or other Miniſtration is leſs uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully performed, and in a manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to what is done by another in another place. But no man will be ſo abſurd as to ſay this may be practiſed,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:40113:189"/>for if it might, there would be no end of ſeparation, but a door would be opened to all confuſion, and People muſt be ſeparating as often as they conceive they have found one Miniſter of a Congregation to excel another in the manner of his Miniſtration. And if Separation may not be practiſed upon this account, then it cannot be duly practiſed for that reaſon that the manner of Worſhip performed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Liturgy, is leſs uſeful and leſs edifying than that which is or may be done after another manner.</p>
               <p n="4">4, It is not the <hi>external manner</hi> of Worſhip, but the <hi>eſſential matter</hi> that is the <hi>Rule</hi> of Chriſtians agreement in one Catholick Communion in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip throughout the world. In the one they are ſtrictly bound up by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular determination; in the other they are left more at large to govern themſelves to the beſt of their underſtanding by general Rules. And the different Circumſtances under which Chriſtians are in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Nations, will neceſſitate them
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:40113:190"/>to uſe ſome difference in practice even while they govern themſelves by the ſame general Rules. <hi>Do all things to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying; Let the peace of God rule in your hearts to which ye are called in one body,</hi> are two general Rules; and Chriſtians are to have reſpect to the one as well as the other in ordering their practice: The ſame Circumſtances of Worſhip will not tend both to edification and to peace alſo, at one time and in one place, which will do ſo at another. Theſe Rules touching Edification and Peace would lead a man to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in his Communion in Publick Worſhip with the Churches in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Geneva,</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> if he ſhould ſojourn in theſe places, than he does while he is here in <hi>England,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the uſages of this National Church: For it would not tend to peace and edification for ſuch an one to make a diſturbance by labouring to ſet on foot among them all the ſame Circumſtances of Worſhip he had been accuſtomed to here becauſe he likes them better. And the ſame is true
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:40113:190"/>of ſuch as come from thoſe forein Churches to ſojourn here, or in any other Reformed Church. The right way of maintaining true Catholick Communion, is to refuſe Communion with no Church in any Country that is Orthodox in the Faith, and in the Eſſence of Worſhip, and is not Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, notwithſtanding any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there may be in the degrees of uſefulneſs in the external manner of Worſhip, between one Church and another, ſo long as they are all uſeful to their end in ſome good meaſure, and agreeable to general Rules in that caſe. I cannot take him for a right Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Chriſtian that can have no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with any Church where he comes but where the external Mode of Worſhip agrees with that which he moſt affects. <hi>When I am at</hi> Rome <hi>I faſt on Saturdays, when I am here (at Milan) I do not,</hi> ſaid St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> to St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. One external Mode of Worſhip is not therefore uſeleſs becauſe another is more uſeful: For a greater degree
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:40113:191"/>of uſefulneſs herein does not exclude a leſs, but only excel it. The geſture of Kneeling in Prayer is better and more ſutable to the nature of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than that of ſtanding; yet that does not make it unlawful to pray ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; One Verſion of the Pſalms is more uſeful to its end than another; yet that does not make it unlawful to joyn with thoſe who uſe that which is leſs uſeful. Nay, I will ſay more than this; That Mode of Worſhip which is beſt under ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, is not ſo under others: As when it cannot be uſed without cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuch a diviſion in the Church as will produce moſt pernicious effects in reference to the Church it ſelf, and to Religion. Upon which account the Diſſenters ought to eſteem it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to joyn in the Worſhip performed by the Liturgy, than in that performed in their Aſſemblies under the ill Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which do attend it, tho they eſteem theirs to be better abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly conſidered.</p>
               <pb n="333" facs="tcp:40113:191"/>
               <p n="6">6. If a leſs degree of uſefulneſs in the external manner of Worſhip ſhould be allowed to be a ſufficient ground of Separation from Communion in it where it is uſed, our Church diviſions would be irrepairable and beyond all remedy in whoſe hands ſoever the ordering the external Circumſtances and manner of Worſhip may fall, be they the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> themſelves, or any other. For when they ſhall have done the beſt they can therein, there will be others who will find out ſome Circumſtantial defects in it that will in their judgment (and perhaps according to truth too) render it leſs uſeful than it was capable of being made. There is ſuch a difference in the thoughts and apprehenſions of wiſe and good men themſelves, and much more in thoſe that are weaker, that it is impoſſible unleſs they were all divinely inſpired, that they ſhould all agree to a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance in ſuch a thing as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal manner of Worſhip, but that ſome will think this, and others will think that might have been better done than it is.</p>
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:40113:192"/>
               <p>There is a neceſſity therefore, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we reſolve to perpetuate diviſion and ſeparation, to take up with the beſt external way and manner of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip we can obtain from the wiſdom of the Nation, ſo long as it is competently uſeful to its end, and not to divide and ſeparate upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our eſteeming it leſs uſeful than we deſire. For otherwiſe it is not to be expected that the beſt wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that is to be found in the Nation ſhould ever be able to find out any way or means of curing our Church diviſions, and to put an end to our unchriſtian-like ſeparations? And to give liberty for every one to do that which he eſteemeth beſt, is fartheſt of all from working ſuch a Rule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be it will be ſaid, and indeed is alledged by ſome, That ſince every man is to worſhip and ſerve God in the beſt manner he can, it follows, that therefore if there be one way of Publick Worſhip, which he eſteems better than another, he is to make uſe of that when he has
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:40113:192"/>opportunity of doing ſo. And by this thoſe that do eſteem the external manner of Worſhip uſed in ſeparate Aſſemblies to be better than that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Liturgy in Parochial Congregations, do labour to defend their ſeparation.</p>
               <p>To this ſeveral things are to be ſaid.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In ordering the Mode or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Publick Worſhip, reſpect is to be had, not to what is moſt accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to one ſort of men only, but to what is uſeful and profitable for the whole Community, as well thoſe who are of a lower capacity as thoſe of a higher, as well thoſe who deſire a Liturgy, as thoſe that do not, and to what is moſt likely to preſerve peace among them. And when the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to this end hath ordered that part of the Publick Worſhip ſhall be performed by the Liturgy, and has allowed a liberty of performing part of it without by Pulpit Prayer; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion is thereby made to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date both the one and the other in
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:40113:193"/>the external manner of Worſhip. And Chriſtian ingenuity and <hi>Charity which ſeeketh not her own,</hi> will teach men to be content that others ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated as well as themſelves in things wherein they may, rather than to make a diviſion in the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all things are not ordered juſt as they would have them. And of this truly Chriſtian ſtrain was St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which made him ſay, <hi>I pleaſe all men in all things, not ſeeking mine own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, but the profit of many that they may be ſaved,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.33. And that it has been the judgment of the Church from Age to Age, that it is beſt for the Church, all things conſidered, that the Publick Worſhip, at leaſt in part, ſhould be performed by a Liturgy, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by their having ordered that ſo it ſhould be. And this ought to weigh much with humble and modeſt men, remembring what St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſaid in another caſe to ſhew what eſteem ought to be had of the Uſages and Cuſtoms of the Churches of God: <hi>If any man ſeem contentious, we have no
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:40113:193"/>Such Cuſtom, neither the Churches of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.16.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To ſatisfie, yea, to convince ſuch as are under a prejudice againſt worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping God by the uſe of our Engliſh Liturgy, that there is no ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as they fancy between the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping God according to that, in conjunction with Pulpit Worſhip, and that way of Worſhip which they ſo much prefer before it, I ſhall offer this to their conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> That there have as worthy men for Piety and Learning, both Conformiſts and Non-conformiſts, as perhaps ever <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> bred, lived and died in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in that Whorſhip which has been performed by our Engliſh Liturgy, from the beginning of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion downward. And we may well conclude that their Souls would never have proſpered and flouriſhed ſo as no mens more, if there had been any ſuch difference as ſome men imagine between the way of their Communion and that of others. Men do not ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Grapes of thorns, nor Figs of
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:40113:194"/>thiſtles. That the ſouls of many proſper no better under it, proceeds not from the nature of the proviſion for them, but from their own groſs neglect both of it, and of themſelves, who doubtleſs would be ſuch as they are, whatever the manner of Worſhip is in the places where they live.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we have, in the place where the providence of God hath ſet us, means of worſhipping God publickly, competently uſeful and ſufficient to the ends of ſuch Worſhip, tho it ſhould in ſome reſpects be inferiour to ſome other; yet if we can have no better without breaking Order, and running into confuſion, nor without breaking one Commandment to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve another, nor without making our ſelves guilty of an unlawful ſeparation, and all the dreadful conſequences of it, we may be ſaid to worſhip God in the beſt manner we can, tho we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our ſelves with this, provided we be not wanting to improve it the beſt we can to its end. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe we then perform the
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:40113:194"/>beſt Worſhip we can that will conſiſt with edification, Publick Order, and the peace of the Church: and a Worſhip wherein all theſe concur, does beſt anſwer to general Rules for the manner of Publick Worſhip, taken together.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For men to ſeparate from Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Communion in the Worſhip per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed according to the Liturgy, to the end God may be worſhipped by them after a better manner in ſeparate Aſſemblies, <hi>is to do evil that good may come of it;</hi> unleſs they can prove a neceſſity ſo to ſeparate or to ſin. For that to ſeparate without ſuch a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>is to do evil,</hi> is a Proteſtant <hi>Maxim</hi> aſſented to on all hands among them. And that they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no ſuch neceſſity as to ſin if they do not ſo ſeparate, I have ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by ſhewing that the ſaid Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is neither corrupt in the eſſence of it, nor is the external manner of performance of it deficient as to its end and uſe; one of which muſt be proved againſt it, before ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:40113:195"/>from it can be juſtified.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By ſuch a ſeparation as that we ſpeak of, men really do much more diſſervice to God and the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of Religion and the Souls of men, than they can with any colour of reaſon pretend that by worſhipping God without the Liturgy, they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him or Religion, or advantage the Souls of men. The effects of ſuch a Separation are very viſible which do too naturally flow from it; ſuch as the deſtruction of Peace, Charity, and Humility, the engendering of Envy, Hatred, Strife, and Contention, to the great reproach of Religion, and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Almighty God, and the hurt of mens Souls, But how theſe great evils can be pretended to be counter-ballanced by their Worſhip being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without the Liturgy, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not; but do take it to be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paſt doubt, that the benefit which thoſe that ſeparate get by their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion without a Liturgy over and above what they might have gained by Communion where that is uſed,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:40113:195"/>will never equal the hurt they draw upon themſelves and others, and the wrong they do to Religion by their ſeparation: And if not, then when ever the account comes to be made up, and their loſs to be compared with their gain, they will be found exceeding great loſers by their ſeparation, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the advantages they promiſed themſelves by it.</p>
               <p>Thus far to ſhew that there is no juſt cauſe of ſeparating from Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the Worſhip performed by the Liturgy every Lords day. As for the geſture of kneeling in the act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Lords Supper; ſo much hath been written to prove it no ſin, and ſo little that looks like an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove the contrary, that if men of underſtanding would but lay aſide prejudice, and impartially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and conſider what hath been ſaid on both ſides, I cannot think that after this, any could be long without ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction touching the lawfulneſs of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with publick Order in that matter; eſpecially conſidering how
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:40113:196"/>much is declared at the end of the Office for adminiſtration of the Lords Supper in the Liturgy, to clear that geſture in that action from all ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Bread-worſhip, more than in the Liturgy in uſe in the old Non-conformiſts days when they ſcrupled it.</p>
               <p>But if any after they have done thus ſhall not for all that be ſatisfied, yet that can be no more an Argument to them than it was to the old Non-conformiſts, why they ſhould not hold Communion in the reſt of the Lords-day Worſhip as they did; and not only ſo, but preſſed it alſo on others as their duty to do ſo, and zealouſly inveyed againſt ſeparation from it as a great evil, as their Writings do abundantly ſhew. And that for ſuch to hold Communion with their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſo far as they can, is plain mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of duty, I have ſhewed before. And in caſe they ſhould thus hold Communion in the other parts of Worſhip, they need no more to live without the uſe of the Lords Supper
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:40113:196"/>than the old Non-conformiſts did, ſince I doubt not but they know how to be therein accommodated as well as they did, and as they were.</p>
               <p>And ſo for Baptiſm, in caſe they cannot be active in the uſe of the Croſs <hi>after it,</hi> yet they may be paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, in as much as it is not uſed as any ſign of Gods conveying grace as Sacraments are, but only as a token of duty; nor as any Rite in Baptiſm neither, but only in receiving the Perſons baptized into the Church af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are baptized, and ſeems to be no more ground of ſcruple, than laying the hand upon, and kiſſing the Book in ſwearing is, which is a piece of Divine Worſhip, which none ſcruple but <hi>Quakers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are others who frame to themſelves other reaſons of ſeparation from Parochial Communion in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip beſides its being performed by the Liturgy, as namely, becauſe thoſe Congregations are not as they pretend, conſtituted of viſible Saints, nor by a Church Covenant. Who theſe are
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:40113:197"/>is well known, for whoſe ſakes ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of my former Inquiries are made: in which there are ſuch things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the holy Scriptures as may, I ſuppoſe, be ſufficient to ſatisfie their reaſon if not their prejudice touching their miſtake in theſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
               <p>As for their exceptions againſt the Government of the Church by Biſhops as <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> how they would make Communion with the particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations under their Juriſdiction un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful upon that account, I underſtand not; unleſs they think the Miniſters of thoſe Congregations by whom the Ordinances are adminiſtred, to be no true Miniſters, becauſe Epiſcopally ordained, and not by Presbyters. And if this ſhould be their ſcruple, they may eaſily receive ſatisfaction by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that Dioceſan Biſhops were <hi>Presbyters.</hi> before they were Biſhops, and therefore muſt needs remain ſo after. For they were not deveſted of any Miniſterial power or authority by being made Biſhops, but only
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:40113:197"/>inveſted with a ſuperaddition of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and power they had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. So that they who are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by them, are ordained by a Presbyterial authority and more. And with this the old Nonconformiſts ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied themſelves touching the validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Miniſterial authority re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by Ordination from the Biſhops that then were.</p>
               <p>Some again diſlike Parochial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, becauſe the Civil Power is ſo much concerned as it is in Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal affairs relating to it one way or other, and for that all ſuch things are not left wholly to the ordering of Eccleſiaſtical Rulers, as they were in the Apoſtles times, and long after.</p>
               <p>But there is not the ſame reaſon why they ſhould be ſo left now, as there was why they were ſo then. The reaſon why they were wholly left then to the ordering of an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Power, was, becauſe there was no Civil Powers as <hi>Chriſtian</hi> then in being, ſo that they could not
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:40113:198"/>promote Chriſtianity better, any other way. But it is not ſo now: for it is ſhewed in our laſt former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry but one, that the affairs of the Goſpel and the Salvation of men in a Chriſtian Kingdom or State, may better be provided for, and promoted by a national Conſtitution, than they can be without it. And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore things of this nature are not to be ordered as if we were ſtill in a <hi>Pagan</hi> Kingdom when we are not.</p>
               <p>For where the reaſon of things is altered, it is but reaſonable and fit that there ſhould be a ſutable alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the things themſelves. Thus the geſture of ſtanding with Loyns girt and a Staff in the hand, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be uſed in eating the Paſsover at the firſt Inſtitution of it, for that it was then to be eaten in <hi>haſte,</hi> was afterwards altered to another geſture by the Church, when that Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of eating in <hi>haſte</hi> ceaſed; and our Saviour himſelf did eat it in that poſture to which the Church had changed it, which is a conſideration
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:40113:198"/>of very great weight in reference to this and ſome other caſes. And the Obligation of the Ceremonial Law ceaſed upon the ſame ground when the ſubſtance was come which had been prefigured by Ceremonial Rites. And the like might be obſerved touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſcontinuance and diſuſe of anointing the ſick, waſhing Diſciples feet, and the kiſs of Charity, and ſome other things which were obliging until the reaſon of the Obligation ceaſed.</p>
               <p>But altho the Civil Power doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it ſelf by a National Conſtitution to order and direct in things apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the Church, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of Religion, and the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men, yet it does not this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the advice and aſſiſtance of thoſe that are Officers, and bear rule in the Church. And when the Civil Powers have gone as far as they think fit in ordering and directing by Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical advice and aſſiſtance, yet they do not act any thing themſelves peculiar to the Miniſtry of the Church,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:40113:199"/>but leave all ſuch things wholly to them who are inveſted with Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial authority; reſerving only to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a power oſ reſtraining ſuch men from an undue exerciſe of their Office tending to publick diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance.</p>
               <p>And thus I have endeavoured to ſatisfie the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> that there is no ſufficient reaſon or cauſe for them to ſeparate from the Publick Worſhip of our Parochial Aſſembles, and that their pretences for their doing ſo when narrowly looked into, are found to have nothing of ſubſtance in them ſufficient to bear them out in it, And if I am not miſtaken in my Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations and reaſonings, I cannot diſcern how their ſeparation can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be defended from being an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Schiſm. And if it be, I am ſure they have upon many accounts great reaſon to deſiſt from engaging farther in it.</p>

               <head>QUERY XV. <hi>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ppoſing things touching viſible Church-Memberſhip and Communion to be as they have been repreſented in our former Inquiries; yet how do they tend to leſſen our Church Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions?</hi>
               </head>
               <p>The anſwer to which is, That if the matters of our Inquiry be as they have been repreſented, then they tend to leſſen our Church-diviſions, by removing and taking away the very foundation on which they and our Church-ſeparations are in great part at leaſt built. For I do not know any one of the different Parties among the Proteſtant Diſſenters (except thoſe called <hi>Presbyterian</hi>) who do not found their ſeparation from our Pariſh Churches (at leaſt principally) upon this ſuppoſition that they are not <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted according to the order of the Goſpel.</hi> And why not according to
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:40113:200"/>the Order of the Goſpel, but becauſe as they ſay they are not conſtituted ol Goſpel matter, that is not of viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Saints, but of ſuch as for a great part of them at leaſt, were never du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reputed to be regenerate, or to be of the Inviſible Church, and their meaning is (as I collect both from their Writings and Converſe) That they were not at firſt, nor ſince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted of ſuch particular members only as at the time of ſuch their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, had a probable appearance of Regeneration, but of all baptized perſons, however they proved good or bad, and without any other proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or diſcrimination.</p>
               <p>Now if thoſe things be true which have been endeavoured to be proved to be ſo in the management of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Enquiries; Then this ground on which they build their ſeparation, is altogether unſound, and ſuch as has no firmneſs or ſubſtance in it, but is only imaginary. For our Pariſh Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations are conſtituted of perſons vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly in Covenant with God the Father,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:40113:200"/>Son, and Holy Ghoſt, by being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in their name, and thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to be theirs, to worſhip and ſerve the Father by the Son through the aſſiſtance of the Spirit. And of ſuch, and no other, were the Churches planted by the Apoſtles, conſtituted: And this Covenanting was then, and ſo is now, the viſible formal difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe of the Viſible Church and thoſe of the world: All under this Character and Badge, and none but they, were of the Viſible Church; and therefore it muſt needs be the Conſtitutive form of that Relation, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church-memberſhip, <hi>All that have been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt,</hi> and are viſibly Chriſtians, and of Chriſts Church. How ancient and how long before Chriſts appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the world in our nature, this way of conſtituting Viſible Church-members has been by ſuch a Rite as God appointed, I have ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>And if this viſible Covenanting with God by Baptiſm be that by
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:40113:201"/>which perſons become Members of the Viſible Church, then a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble appearance of Regeneration, or a reputation of being of the Church as inviſible cannot be it that makes them viſible Church Members, tho it does qualifie them for it, unleſs this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable appearance of Regeneration, and Covenanting with God by Baptiſm, be one and the ſame thing: And if they be, then thoſe of which our Pariſh Churches are conſtituted, have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable appearance of Regeneration, or of being of the Inviſible Church, and then they are conſtituted of matter according to thoſe Diſſenters own mind: And if ſo, then we may well hope they will no longer ſeparate from them, as if they were not Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted of qualified matter. So that things are brought at laſt to this iſſue, That theſe Diſſenters muſt either overthrow this Plea againſt the reaſon and ground of their Separation, and prove that viſible Covenanting with God by Baptiſm is not that by which Viſible Church-memberſhip is made,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:40113:201"/>or elſe it will certainly overthrow this Plea of theirs for their Separation. And if they will ſo much as attempt to overthrow this Plea againſt them; they muſt row all the way againſt the ſtream and ſtrong tide of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and againſt the ſtream of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and the ſenſe of the ancient Church from the Apoſtles times down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, who always eſteemed Baptiſm the <hi>door of entrance</hi> into the Viſible Church; and conſequently that all ſuch as had paſs'd through Baptiſm, were within the Church.</p>
               <p>And as it is more agreable to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo it is much more reaſonable to ſay, that men cannot ſeem to be of the Church as Inviſible, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt of the Church as Viſible, than it is to ſay their being of the Church as Viſible, proceeds from their ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be of the Church as Inviſible. For as touching mens enterance into the Church by Baptiſm, our Saviour hath ſaid, <hi>Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> Joh. 3.5.
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:40113:202"/>And Baptiſm is injoyned in order to the obtaining Remiſſion of ſin and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which are Priviledges of the Church as Inviſible, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. and 22.16. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. So that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theſe Scriptures, mens being and ſeeming to be of the Church as Inviſible, and their ſharing in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of it, ſeems ordinarily to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon their being of the Viſible Church by Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Now one would think a Notion ſo prepoſterous as this oppoſed appears to be, ſhould be very unfit to make a foundation to build Churches upon, or to juſtifie a ſeparation from thoſe which have a ſubſtantial foundation, the Scriptures I mean.</p>
               <p>But if mens ſeeming in the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of others to be of the Church as Inviſible, did not depend upon their being of the Church Viſible, yet ſuch ſeeming could be no proper or fit Rule by which to judg, determine, and conclude who are, and who are not of the Viſible Church. And the reaſon is, becauſe it is <hi>Arbitrarious
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:40113:202"/>and uncertain:</hi> for mens being or not being acknowledged to be of the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, would depend upon the uncertainty of mens opinions and affections: and thoſe would ſeem in ſome mens apprehenſions to be of the Church Inviſible, which to others would ſeem otherwiſe: And then thoſe would be owned by ſome to be of the Viſible Church, which would be denied to be ſo by others. Of the truth of all which this preſent Age hath furniſhed us with plentiful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: And if this ſhould be the Rule obſerved through the whole Chriſtian world, it would be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy way to make Parties and Sidings, unchriſtian oppoſitions, and unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table cenſurings among Chriſtians, in all parts of the world, as it has done here in this Nation.</p>
               <p>Whereas to be viſibly in Covenant with God by Baptiſm, is a <hi>certain, fixed, a common, open and publick Rule,</hi> by which to judg who are of the Viſible Church, ſo long as they continue to own themſelves under the obligation
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:40113:203"/>of that Covenant; and have neither ſo far violated it as to give Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to other Objects than their God, nor incurr'd to themſelves Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication by Hereſie, or other ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous living. And this Rule gives no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of diviſion in the Church as the other does, but tends to bind and hold the ſeveral Members together in <hi>the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Spirit and bond of peace:</hi> To which purpoſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> urgeth it upon the Chriſtians, motive-wiſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>All theſe things conſidered, one would wonder how men of Learning and Piety ſhould ever be betrayed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch Notions and Principles, and to lay ſo mighty a ſtreſs on them as they have done, when yet they have no more colour from Scripture or reaſon than ever yet they have been able to produce for their defence.</p>
               <p>But to make the beſt of it I can, we will ſuppoſe it was the appearance of a more thorow Reformation, and more pure Communion, which in their apprehenſion was to be obtained by theſe new Methods, that firſt
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:40113:203"/>drew them into this way. Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and pure Communion, are things which ſound mighty well in good mens ears, and which they can eaſily believe to be well pleaſing unto God. And as there is an appearance of <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtrictneſs</hi> in that way than in that of more general Communion, ſo it was eaſie for them hereupon to think there <hi>was more purity in it alſo;</hi> which has been the prevailing reaſon which has carried multitudes into <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> And when ſuch an opinion has once ſeated it ſelf in mens minds, they quickly grow confident that nothing in Scripture can be againſt it: and then they can eaſily fancy that every ſlight appearance and ſound of words in Scripture is for them, upon which they can but put ſuch a gloſs as ſhall favour them, though it be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to their purpoſe when impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcann'd.</p>
               <p>And had their opinions and practice which I have oppoſed, and wherein they differ from all other good men, been matter of purity indeed, I ſhould not
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:40113:204"/>have made One to find fault with them. But if this their Way be diſagreeable to Gods pure Word, (which is the Rule by which we muſt judg of what is pure, and what is impure) and if it run counter to our Lords Method laid down in the Scripture of ordering the affairs of his Church, in very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial points, then it will be found an impure practice, a ſinful mixture, and a corruption to be purged out of the Church: And yet ſuch it is, if I have not miſrepreſented that Method of our Lord in the general tenour of my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries. And indeed, if I have not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken wrong meaſures, and unleſs very much miſtaken, their Communion in their ſtate of Separation, if taken al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, and the terms on which it is held, muſt needs be far more impure than the Parochial Communion they have withdrawn from.</p>
               <p>There are extreams on both hands, as well on the right hand as on the left: and there is a proneneſs in men to run into the one by flying from the other. And good men, eſpecially in matters
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:40113:204"/>of publick Reformation, are through miſtaken zeal more in danger of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into an extreme on the right hand than into one on the left, and in flying from <hi>Babylon,</hi> to run beyond <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And there is a danger of doing much hurt in the Church by <hi>over-doing</hi> as well as there is by <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing,</hi> and both extremes are carefully to be avoided.</p>
               <p>The <hi>New England</hi> Miniſters in their Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Davenport,</hi> formerly mentioned, do ſay; <hi>We may be very injurious to Chriſt as well as the Souls of men, by too much ſtraitening and narrowing the bounds of his Kingdom or Viſible Church here on earth. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly enlargement, ſo it be a regular enlargement, is a very deſirable thing. In Church Reformation it is an obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble truth (ſaith</hi> Pareus <hi>on the Parable of the Tares) that they which are for too much ſtraitneſs do more hurt than profit the Church.</hi> So much they, <hi>p.</hi> 45. Thus the miſtaken zeal of the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> and <hi>Novatians</hi> of old, for a purer Church, and purer Communion, as
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:40113:205"/>was thought or pretended put them upon ſeparating from other Orthodox Chriſtians, which proved an inlet to the moſt unchriſtian practices ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, for the carrying on their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken Reformation, and deſtructive of the peace of the Church in the higheſt, and lamentably ſcandalous to the Chriſtian Religion; in the Doctrinal part whereof notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were for the moſt part all agreed, as we are now, and differ moſtly about Diſciplinary Points as they did then.</p>
               <p>Such a ſtrictneſs in Church Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation as does ſo narrow and leſſen the Viſible Church, as to endeavour to reduce it to the ſize of the Inviſible, is many ways hurtful, as I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my Reaſons for the contrary. It tends to hinder and leſſen the great work of thorow and ſound Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the Church: It tends to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſpreading and propagating of the Chriſtian Religion: It tends to harden men in an unſafe condition: It tends to deprive <hi>good</hi> men of
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:40113:205"/>Communion with the Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Notion of <hi>bad:</hi> It tends to ruine the Church as to its exiſtence in the world: And laſtly, it tends to beget and foment diviſions, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, feuds, envyings, ſtrifes, and undue cenſurings among Chriſtians, and ſo to caſt the Church into a ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtate, and ſuch as threatens her ſpiritual life: Beſides, the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and advantage which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by given to our common Enemies to plot and attempt againſt us. And thus <hi>over-doing,</hi> is indeed <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And leſt any ſhould be offended at a diſcourſe againſt over-much ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It ought to be conſidered that there is a great difference between a mans being ſtrict towards himſelf, and in reference to his own practice, and his being ſtrict and ſevere towards others in depriving them of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Priviledges of Chriſtian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors. A man cannot well be too ſtrict in keeping a narrow watch over his own heart, words, and ways,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:40113:206"/>in governing his Appetites, Thoughts and Paſſions, Tongue and Actions. Nor does this kind of ſtrictneſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon ſuch a purity of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants or Communion in which no Carnal Chriſtians have any ſhare: But it depends upon, or rather it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a due attention of mens minds to their own duty, and to the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of receiving good by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God.</p>
               <p>The reſt of the Gueſts in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble were not the worſe, nor did fare the worſe, for that there was one among them that had not on the Wedding Garment. The ordinances of God do not the leſs avail good men that with a due frame of mind wait upon God in them, tho unregenerate men participate with them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <p>And when by the Cenſures of the Church, Capital Offenders, and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſcandalous Perſons are deprived of Communion with the Church, it is not for that reaſon as if the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God were the leſs uſeful
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:40113:206"/>to the good by ſuch mens ſharing in them: But it is to bring ſuch Perſons to ſhame, and by that means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and to free the Church from that diſhonour which otherwiſe would ſtick upon it for tolerating ſuch ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous perſons among them: And partly alſo for admonition to others, and to prevent the tainting of ſuch as are leſs wary by their ill example and familiar converſe. But otherwiſe bad mens ſharing in external Communion with the Church, is no ways likely to hinder the growth of good men in grace, or their profiting by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God there adminiſtred. <hi>To the pure all things are pure:</hi> Bad men cannot in the leaſt pollute the Ordinances of God to the good by their participating with them in them.</p>
               <p>And therefore if God would have ſuch as are not obnoxious to Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication for Capital Crimes, tho not Regenerate, to be continued in the Church, being once received into it by Baptiſm, to the end they might
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:40113:207"/>be under the influence of his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances for their Converſion: I ſay, if God would have it thus in order to their Converſion; no good man ſhould envy or grudge them this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of enjoying the means of ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. And they eſpecially ſhould not who have themſelves been Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and Regenerated in the ſame way of general Communion, and by the means therein afforded; which yet has been the caſe, I doubt not, of ſuch as have been leading men in modelling this new Church way, as it has been of many others. For their Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations at the firſt, and long after, conſiſted ſcarcely of any other than what had been drawn out of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial Congregations where they had been Converted, if they were indeed Converted, as they ſuppoſed them to be, before their incorporating and aſſociating in their new way. And if they had continued in the ſame way wherein they were by Gods bleſſing upon the means of Grace they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in enjoyed, made ſuch as they then
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:40113:207"/>were, they might without doubt have attained to as much growth in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Virtues as ever they did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and, I think, much more, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they had but diligently and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully improved the ſame means and opportunities by which they had acquired what they had then attained to.</p>
               <p>For the Word and Ordinances of the Goſpel which are the means of increaſe of Grace as well as of the beginning of it, are the ſame, and will produce the ſame effects in thoſe who with a good frame of mind attend upon God in them, as well when unregenerate men ſhare in them as when they do not. And therefore neither the holy Prophets, or other holy men of greateſt Piety under the Old Teſtament, nor our Saviour or his Apoſtles, or any other holy men in the Primitive times of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, did ever decline the Publick Worſhip, or the uſe of Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances in ſuch Aſſemblies where bad men, as well as good, had Communion
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:40113:208"/>in them. Such a mixture of bad with good cannot hinder good men from any growth in Grace by thoſe Ordinances, if they have but a due care to make the beſt improvement of them they can. And therefore there can be no <hi>need</hi> of ſeparating and new aſſociating in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to mens own growth in Grace, tho we ſhould ſuppoſe it poſſible they could be ſure it were ſimply lawful. Which makes ſuch ſeparation on the one had, and aſſociating on the other, the more inexcuſable, when it cauſes ſo much hurt to the Church in general, and ſuch obſtruction to the ſucceſs of the Goſpel in the world, as hath been ſhewn it does, and would do more if it ſhould more generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.</p>
               <p>The <hi>few names</hi> in the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> did not defile their Garments by communicating with the greater number of thoſe that had: Nor did they thereby deprive themſelves of the benefit which Chriſt deſigned them by his Ordinances, either by having their minds diſcompoſed by
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:40113:208"/>ſuch a mixture of Communicants, or otherwiſe: For if they had, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think that our Saviour, who <hi>walked in the midſt of his golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, ſearching the reins and the hearts to give to every one according to their works,</hi> would have applauded them as he did, with promiſe of great reward, ſaying, <hi>They ſhall walk with me in white, for they are worthy,</hi> Rev, 3.4.</p>
               <p>And now for a Concluſion, That no man may take offence at the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in theſe Papers, nor at me for the ſake of it, I muſt inform thoſe that are moſt likely to do ſo, of two things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That if I had diſcerned that what is herein pleaded had had no better foundation than ſome few ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Texts of Scripture of dubious and uncertain Interpretation, I ſhould not thus far have engaged in it as I have done. But if it ſhall appear to others, as it does to me, that I have the general ſtream of the Scriptures on my ſide herein, both of the Old Teſtament and of the New, both
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:40113:209"/>as to matter of Doctrine, and matter of Fact; I hope I ſhall be excuſed for making this Eſſay for the ſatisfaction of thoſe that moſt need it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That I take the ſcope and deſign of the whole of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in theſe Papers, to be perfectly agreeable to Chriſtian Charity, as tending to no mans hurt, but to the general good of all ſorts, elſe I ſhould not have been ſatisfied in it. For I know not how to think any thing Orthodox in Divinity, which is againſt Charity. Now if the extent of Viſible Church-Memberſhip and Communion pleaded for, tends more to the Converſion of ſuch of them as are unregenerate, and not otherwiſe obnoxious to Excommunication, than the excluding ſuch from both would do, then what I plead for is great Charity to them.</p>
               <p>And this extent of Viſible Church-Memberſhip and Communion, tends to propagate and ſpread the Chriſtian Religion among thoſe that are yet without the Church more than the
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:40113:209"/>narrower way can do, as has been ſhewn, and therefore its matter of Charity to them alſo.</p>
               <p>And in that this more general way of Viſible Church-Memberſhip and Communion is not pleaded to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the uſefulneſs of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in reference to Capital Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but the contrary, that's matter of Charity to them alſo: Becauſe by that they may be brought to ſhame, and ſo unto Repentance, when they ſee all ſober Chriſtians aſhamed to own them, or to be numbred with them, as being a diſgrace to the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion they profeſs. And I am ſo far from being leſs for the exerciſe of Church-Diſcipline upon the proper Objects of it, than our Diſſenting Friends are, That I think it a piece of great uncharitableneſs towards groſs Sinners, when it is neglected by them to whom the exerciſe of it does belong. Only I would have the Scripture Rules obſerved in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it, and not uſe ſuch ſeverity as to exclude all ſuch from Church-Communion
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:40113:210"/>as may be ſuſpected to be unregenerate, when yet not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of any Hereſie, ſcandalous Crimes, or groſs ignorance: For men may give occaſion of ſuſpicion of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regeneracy by ſuch ſinful neglects of doing good, as yet may be no juſt ground of Excommunication.</p>
               <p>Neither is this more extenſive way of Viſible Church-Memberſhip and Communion, hurtful to thoſe that are good, but gives them opportunity of doing the more good; and therefore is no matter of uncharitableneſs unto them neither. For this will not hinder them from being as good as they have a mind to be, if nothing elſe do. They may be as ſtrict as they will in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to themſelves: And they will not be at the leſs, but the more liberty to converſe with the beſt men for their own improvement in wiſdom and goodneſs.</p>
               <p>And then it will be beneficial to them by putting them into a capacity and giving them an opportunity of doing more good than otherwiſe they could. For while good men do not
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:40113:210"/>ſeparate themſelves from formal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the ſame Religion, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them from Communion with them in the means of Grace; they the better preſerve their own eſteem among them, and the eſteem of that wherein they excel them; and they will be the more ready to hearken to them in their advice and counſel, and in their admonition or reproof, and the ſooner be brought to imitate their Virtues. Whereas a contrary carriage produces contrary effects. For ſeparation from Neighbours as no Members of a truly Chriſtian Church when yet they are ſo, breeds more or leſs eſtrangedneſs between them, and that begets prejudices againſt them, and jealouſies and ſuſpicions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as men wanting in true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Charity and Humility, which will make them the leſs valued, and their good Counſels and Exhortations the leſs regarded, and their good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in what is worthy imitation, the leſs taking with, and the leſs gaining upon ſuch men.</p>
               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:40113:211"/>
               <p>A Diſcourſe likewiſe which evinceth a more extenſive Viſible Church-Memberſhip and Communion to be approved of by God than theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Brethren will allow, muſt needs be matter of Charity to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more eſpecially. For it tends to reſcue and deliver them from ſuch error as makes them injurious to the Church of God, and the affairs of the Goſpel in the World. And what good man is there that would not be glad to be delivered from ſuch apprehenſions as made him troubleſom even to good men themſelves without any cauſe! And from ſuch opinions as have kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a fire of contention and diſcord in the Church, deſtructive of that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Charity without which all we do in Religion will ſignifie nothing. It is certainly a great grief to all good men that there ſhould be any bar in the way to keep them at any undue diſtance from one another, and conſequently it muſt be very grateful to them when ever it is removed.</p>
               <pb n="373" facs="tcp:40113:211"/>
               <p>This more general way of Viſible Church-Memberſhip and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being then more uſeful and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to all ſorts of men than the other is, and truly hurtful to none: I ſay, it being a way and Method ſo ful of Charity in the nature of it, and ſo agreeable to Moral Principles of wiſdom and goodneſs as it appears to be, would commend it ſelf to right reaſon, and to that natural light that is in men, if it ſhould not have had that evidence from ſupernatural Revelation to back and authorize it which it has. The conſideration of which, as it was a great motive to me to engage in the defence of it, ſo I hope it will plead my excuſe in every good mans Conſcience for this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking. For indeed, I that do cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know my own mind, do know that I have more love and true reſpect for the Perſons whoſe Opinions I have herein oppoſed, than to wiſh or do any thing that tends to their hurt.</p>
               <pb n="374" facs="tcp:40113:212"/>
               <p>And now methinks I might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably promiſe this to my ſelf, that ſuch as love Truth for truth ſake, and are of the number of thoſe that will <hi>buy the truth,</hi> but not <hi>ſell it</hi> at any rate whatſoever, ſhould not be unwilling to lay aſide all prejudice and ſelf intereſt, and to conſider impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially a thing of this nature by what hand ſoever it be prepared; and yet that is all that I deſire from them for whoſe ſakes this Diſcourſe was compoſed.</p>
